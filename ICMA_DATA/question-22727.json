      "text": "\n\nHi Ted.  We consolidated our building, planning, and the development portions of our engineering departments into a Department of Development Services.  We put our permit center as the forefront of activity, and created a Program Manger position who has horizontal hierarchal authority across departments for those employees who contribute to the development review process.  After a LEAN Kaizan on Land Use Permits, we are now able to process a full permit in approximately 90 days, which is a 50% efficiency enhancement.  Through e-plan, developers are now able to submit planning documents electronically saving the developer thousands of dollars in printing costs, and saving the City warehousing space and development review time.  Hope this is helpful.  Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss further.\n\n\nHi Ted.
