      "text": "\n\nHere is a policy that Park City uses:\nPolicy 424 -  RAPID DEPLOYMENT TEAM/ACTIVE SHOOTER\n424.1  PURPOSE AND SCOPE \nViolence in schools, workplaces and other locations by any individual or group of individuals presents a difficult situation for law enforcement. The purpose of this policy is to identify guidelines and factors that will assist responding officers as they make decisions in these rapidly unfolding and tense situations.\n424.2  POLICY \nThe policy of the Department in dealing with the crisis situation shall be:\na.     To obtain and maintain complete operative control of the incident.\nb.     To explore every reasonably available source of intelligence regarding the circumstances, location and suspect(s) in the incident.\nc.     To attempt, by every means available, to attain any tactical advantage over the responsible individual(s).\nd.     To attempt, whenever feasible, a negotiated surrender of the suspect(s) and release of the hostages through the expertise of the members of this department and others.\ne.     When an emergency situation exists, neutralize the threat as rapidly as reasonably possible to minimize injury and loss of life.\nNothing in this policy shall preclude the use of necessary force, deadly or otherwise, by members of the Department in protecting themselves or others from death or serious injury.\n424.3  PROCEDURE \nIf violent acts by the suspect continue, and lives are in imminent danger, a decision to advance on the suspect may be made by the officers at the scene. This decision should include the following considerations:\na.     If the officer is alone, can he/she wait for two or more officers to assist? It is highly recommended that any advance on a suspect be made in teams of two or more.\nb.     Develop and implement immediate and planned tactics, and communicate this plan to others in the field and the duty supervisor.\nc.     Consider deploying rifles, shotguns, shields, control devices and any other appropriate tools that will provide a tactical advantage.\n424.3.1  DECISION TO ADVANCE ON SUSPECT \nThe decision to advance on the suspect(s) is a decision that the on-scene first responders must make. The multitude of variables in such a circumstance requires a rapid assessment of the situation, a decision as to the best tactics to implement and the timely action necessary to resolve the incident. The following are some examples:\na.     Barricaded suspect - Wait for additional assistance; probable SWAT response if the situation is not resolved in a timely manner.\nb.     Barricaded suspect with hostages and no harm done to the hostages - Wait for additional assistance or SWAT response.\nc.     Suspect actively shooting hostages or others in the area - Take immediate action, if possible, to neutralize the threat presented by the suspect, while calling for assistance.\n\n\nHere is a policy that Park City uses:\n\nPolicy 424 -  RAPID DEPLOYMENT TEAM/ACTIVE SHOOTER\n\n424.1  PURPOSE AND SCOPE \n\nViolence in schools, workplaces and other locations by any individual or group of individuals presents a difficult situation for law enforcement.
