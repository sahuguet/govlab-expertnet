  "text": "\n\nNorth Kingstown has received several applications for large wind turbines.  We passed an ordinance which appeared reasonable. The residential protests started with the first application being filed for a turbine to be located on a farm within a 1/2 mile of a residential area.\nThe Town placed a moratorium on new applications to reassess the ordinance.  Has any community implemented an ordinance for wind turbines that NK could review and potentially copy?\n\n",
