  "text": "\n\nOur city is interested in implementing a 360-degree evaluation tool for employees.  I'm looking for information from other cities who have developed a 360 tool.  Do you still have that in place?  Do you have any policies that reflect how the 360 evaluation links to merit increases for pay for performance?  Do you have any policies that define how the tool is used, such as how do you determine the number of evaluators in the subordinate and peer categories, how are the specific evaluators selected, etc?  What has been your employees\u2019 response to using this evaluation?  Thanks for any insight you can provide.\n\n",
