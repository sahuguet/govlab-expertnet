      "text": "\n\nHi Robert, \nI was poking around the E-Government topic page on the Knowledge Network, and I found a document by Mike Gilbar at the Vermont League of Cities & Towns, titled \u201cTech Check: Is It Worth It? Making E-Government Purchasing Decisions,\u201d that I think may help you with your research.  The brief paper outlines the things that a person needs to consider before making a purchase, suggests that, in general, qualitative attributes should not be measured in perceived dollar amounts, and lays out methods for calculating the return on investment for e-government initiatives.  The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) method outlined in the paper may be especially helpful for you.  \nYou can find the \u201cTech Check\u201d paper at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/5906/Tech_Check_Is_It_Worth_It_Making_EGovernment_Purchasing_Decisions and find more resources about calculating ROI for E-Government on the E-Government topic page.  Thanks again for reaching out to us with your question!!\nAloha,\nJames Davidson\nKnowledge Network Intern\n\n\nHi Robert, \n\nI was poking around the E-Government topic page on the Knowledge Network, and I found a document by Mike Gilbar at the Vermont League of Cities & Towns, titled \u201cTech Check: Is It Worth It?
