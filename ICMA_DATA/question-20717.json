The mall paid his wages and the cost of a patrol vehicle. \nThe mall is a small city within itself. Not only do you have to deal with the criminals and shoppers you have to address the employees. With the mall in my former jurisdiction we had a high call volume for larceny/property crimes ID thefts, domestic issues, narcotics, and motor vehicle accidents. Depending on the size of your department it may be overwhelming for one person to cover the entire mall. Feel free to message me back with additional questions.\n\n\nIn my last department we were responsible for one of the largest malls on the East coast.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Wheat Ridge, CO, will have a very large shopping center openning sometime in 2012.  The center will be home to a Cabella's store, two other large box stores, four smaller box stores, a hotel, resturants and many smaller store fronts.  The shopping center is located on the opposite side of the city from the police department. We are exploring the possibility of a sub-station and are researching what types of police activity will increase.\nWe would like information on sub-stations in these shopping centers and any information on experiances with these types of projects both during and after construction.\n\n",
