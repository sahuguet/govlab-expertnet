For the reasons above this is an extremely difficult question to answer at the organization level, but at the department or single service delivery area, this could be possible.  You could then ask the question, \u201cHow many city employees per thousand population does it take to deliver a certain level of performance for police services?\u201d\nPerformance measurement can be used to ascertain certain variable factors (population and level of service provided) to show, for example, that the police department has X number of employees.  Using those numbers, you can then begin to assess what kind of service your jurisdiction delivers (or, wishes to deliver), and figure out a value for total employees number based off of that.  Can\u2019t really be done at the top, city-wide, level, but could definitely be done on a department by department basis.  It also helps steer the discussion towards the ability to deliver a particular level of service to residents.\nICMA\u2019s Center for Performance Measurement offers a way to answer these types of questions.

I assume there are variables, such as the number of services provided, but is there such a thing as a base number from which to start?\n\n",
