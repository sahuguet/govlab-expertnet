  "text": "\n\nWater/wastewater being a 24/7 operation, it is imperative that there is 24 hour coverage 365 days a year and scheduling can be cumbersome at times.  We currently have three 8 hour shifts (day, swing, night) along with a rover and relief to serve multiple locations. Scheduling is currently done using an Excel program that has worked well, but we are looking to step it up to  an automated system that would service multiple locations/shifts and maintain other vital information to optimally manage time and budgets.  With that said, we are looking for what other entities have in the way of shift types, scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly roations, etc.), as well as scheduling tools.  Any information regarding this area would be very much appreciated.\n\n",
