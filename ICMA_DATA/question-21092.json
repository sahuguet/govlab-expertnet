      "text": "\n\nThe main problem with giving exempt employee's 'credit time' is that you are now making them into an hourly employee and setting up a potential huge liability for your organization in the future. My organization, had this 'credit time' arrangement prior to my arrival as the CFO. This credit time was given to employees for hours worked in excess of a 40 hour week, which in effect negated their exempt status.\nIf an employee is classified 'exempt' and truly falls under the guidelines and should be an exempt employee. The assumption is that they will work however long it takes to get the job done, whether that is 30 hours per week or 120 hours per week. The benefit to being exempt is if you take time off in less than full day increments, then typically you do not have to report this as usage of accrued leaves, (this depends based upon your organization's personnel policies and contractual arrangements). But, by allowing 'credit time' it appears you are allowing staff to have the best of both worlds, and incurring a large liability at the employee's time of separation.\n\n\nThe main problem with giving exempt employee's 'credit time' is that you are now making them into an hourly employee and setting up a potential huge liability for your organization in the future.

      "text": "\n\nHere we distinguish between how employees accrue additional work hours based on their FLSA exempt/nonexempt status. Our nonexempt employees accrue the typical compensable (\"comp\") time at 1:1.5 for hours above 40 in a week. We allow exempt employee to accrue \"Excess\" time. Excess time is always accrued at and 1:1 basis for hours above 40 in a week. We call it Excess time so there is not confusion regarding the employee ever being paid (\"compensated\") for the time. These exempt employees must use their excess time by the end of the next pay period following the accural pay period, otherwise the time is lost. We remind exempt employees that this is a privilege, not a right, that is offered here in Halifax County; the employees have expressed appreciation with this system. As with any accrual of comp/excess time, it has to be preapproved by the employee's supervisor. FYI - My background is in HR and I also implemented this when I worked in a community college district in a previous life; this change was based on a lawsuit directive that we pay a departing \"exempt\" employee for their additional time because we called it \"comp\" time. I'll be happy to share our policy if you like.\n\n\nHere we distinguish between how employees accrue additional work hours based on their FLSA exempt/nonexempt status.

It was tracked like other leave times, but it did not accumulate and was not paid at separation.  The City Manager also could award the time to Department Directors.   The downside was that it was awarded at the beginning of the year, based on the projection of what the Director expected the workload to be for certain employees.
