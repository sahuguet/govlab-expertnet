They had a community-wide committee that actually came up with the idea.  Contact Brian Knudsen in the City Manager\u2019s Office at bknudsen@lasvegasnevada.gov for more information.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Charlottesville has started planning for the City's 250th Anniversary.  City Council will be appointing a citizen/community Steering Commitee but a question has been raised about who or what entity will actually organize and plan events, provide the needed struture to the Steering Commitee, etc.  We are interested in learning about how others have done this - did you outsource or do all in house?  If you had a Steering Commitee, how did you get them to focus and provide some structure?  \nResponses can be either posted here or sent directly to Ric Barrick, Director of Communications, at barrick@charlottesville.org.\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
