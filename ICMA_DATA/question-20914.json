I have found two documents from cemeteries in the UK that tend to focus their efforts on signage and trying to attract what they believe community members want. Generally, it seems as though they market their cemeteries more as parks to attract visitors.\nMargravine Cemetery (pages 51-52):\nhttp://bit.ly/h932ke\nWood Green Cemetery (pages 36-40):\nhttp://bit.ly/gtvtA6\nAlso, the Illinois Municipal League published an article titled \u201cCompetitive Community Marketing: Fluff is Not Enough,\u201d that describes fundamental marketing strategies. Although the document is not specifically targeted towards cemeteries, it should give you a good idea about possible ways to structure your marketing strategy.\nhttp://bit.ly/gFEOxP\nI hope this helps!\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Randall, \n\nI have been able to find a few resources that you might find useful.

Having never marketed a cemetery before, I am hoping some of you have some suggestions about how to develop a marketing strategy for the cemetery.  Any advice is welcome.\n- Scott Dixon, Town of Westlake, TX  817-320-1712.\n\n",
