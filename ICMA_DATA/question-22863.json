Improving access to Matthews by making NC-74 a freeway should not decimate the economic activity(and tax base) in the neighborhoods it passes through. If it seems likely to do so then Matthews should contribute to efforts to mitigate the damage done.\nLikewise, if the infrastructure of one community benefits another.

On the Knowledge Network there are different documents about local governments being good neighbors to one another in many different ways. Below are a few examples of what we have on the Knowledge Network:\nThe Casa Grande Intergovernmental Agreement is between about the future boundaries of a few communities located near one another. icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/20875\nThe Community Business Attraction and Anti-Piracy Compact is another agreement between neighboring local governments. icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/304558\nThere are even local governments that are working together to share infrastructure from the beginning.
