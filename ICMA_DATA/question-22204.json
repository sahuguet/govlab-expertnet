This model has been endorsed by ICMA's Center for Management Strategies as a leading practice for local governments and offers a proven tool for identifying the programs/services offered by your jurisdiction, their costs and an evaluation of those services in light of your community's priorities and strategies.   Ultimately, the tool will guide elected officials and appointed staff through the appropriate policy questions needed to set budgetary expenditures based on community strategies and priorities.  \nICMA has endorsed this process as a leading practice because of its comprehensive approach to budgeting, its linkage to work that supports the priorities/goals of the organization and the ultimate identification of expenditures that support the work on critical priorities and goals (as well as those that don\u2019t support the community priorities!)\nCPBB has an impressive client list of cities across the US that have effectively utilized this process.  A client listing can be found on the websites listed below.\nYou can find additional information at the Center for Management Strategies website at icma.org/management strategies or at the Center for Priority Based Budgeting website at http://www.pbbcenter.org/        The Center for Management Strategies also has an active blog site on the Knowledge Network that features a number of articles and information on the Priority Based Budgeting Process and can be found athttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/blogs/blog/50/Center_for_Management_Strategies  \nI encourage you to take a look at this process for your budget prioritization needs.
