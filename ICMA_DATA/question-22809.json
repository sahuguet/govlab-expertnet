If the law indicates person A is responsible for a certain task rather than person B, but person A has the authority to delegate that responsibility to person B via determination of duties related to person B's job, the conflict in the ordinance-versus-job description seems to disappear.  But the default answer would be to ask legal counsel as a follow up to this general observation (if as I presume you want something more than your supervisor's input).  Hope this is at least marginally helpful.\n\n\nIs there really a conflict here?

My job description places the majority of the Financial Responsibilities on my position, yet our older Ordinances put the responsibilities on my immediate supervisor, the CFO. My question is which would trump the other, the Ordinance or the job description?\n\n",
