  "text": "\n\nWe would like to adopt a policy that governs our City Council's attendance at special trips or on trips that have limited seating/availability and require the payment of a substantial registration fee, something along the lines of a Chamber of Commerce strategic visit.  In our minds, this policy may address determining how the Councilmember(s) are selected, is there a maximum number of trips per year, a maximum amount the City will pay, foreign trips, etc.\nAdditionally, we want to touch on payments for spouses/partners attending events - not trips, but awards dinners, Chamber events, etc.  Does the City pay for any of those types of events, does it depend on the type of event, etc?\nIf you have any adopted policies/procedures or insight on either of these areas, I'd appreciate it!\nJessica Roth\nCity of Suwanee\n\n",
