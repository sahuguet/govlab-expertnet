Although they are discussing information in general the document states that while you always want to take the high road, correcting misinformation is always a good idea. If there is a polite way to comment on the blogs or tweet at them with this correct information that may be something you could look info. http://bookstore.icma.org/freedocs/avoid_pitfalls.pdf\nHopefully other local government officials will be able to weigh in with their personal experiences on this complex topic. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Ryan, \n\nYou may find this excerpt from the first time administrators handbook useful.

If a legitimate web site or organization's communications has factual errors, I will let them know the accurate information.  BLOGS are generally run by people who already have a strong opinion of the agency and all responding will do is get you bogged down in a circular debate.  They will never believe you nor will they change their views. I served as interim city manager recently in a town which the city manger felt he needed to correct misinformation.  As a result of the debacles that invariably ensued these exchanges, it resulted in the manager being fired.  With rare exception, I have not known any of these folks to change their perspective or future BLOGs regardless of what the facts are.\nWhat I do is make certain our web site is accurate with appropriate links to documents.  I also place articles int he city's newsletter on issues that were active int he BLOGS. (This may change one day, but have found that printed newsletters still work best, reach more people and have a much longer  shelf life then e-blast or electronic newsletters.)\nYou can get the information out by many, many means including the media, just not by debating a handful of usually strongly opinionated people over the internet or email.  Remember, you see  their BLOGS, most people in your community don't see these BLOGS and generally don't care about them.  Newspapers, however,  love the controversy of the interpersonal debate.\n\n\nI almost never answer or respond to BLOGS anymore then gadflies at council meetings.  It is often the same people.
