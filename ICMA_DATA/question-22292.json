  "text": "\n\nDear Sir/Madam\nI'm a PhD student in University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. My field of research is public economics. A research idea that I'm pursuing is evaluating the economic and social impacts of public libraries.\nLong story short, talking to Debra J. Lissak, executive director of Urbana Free Library in my town, I got informed with Public Library Innovation grant programs conducted by IMCA. While I have been reading about it in IMCA's website, I'm particularly interested in how the grants were awarded. Which characteristics determined receiving the grant and if there is any randomness associated with the granting procedure (randomness is desirable in impact analysis).\nI appreciate your time and help.\n\n",
