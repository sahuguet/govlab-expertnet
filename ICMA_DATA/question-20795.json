  "text": "\n\nAs I practiced civic engagement in Redwood City one of the important learnings early on was not to get hung up on the numbers of people who show up to a civic engagement event.  There is a wise saying among indigenous people regarding group meetings:  \"Whoever shows up are the right people, whatever happens is what is meant to happen, and when it is over it is over\"  Early on it is more important to experiment with different civic engagement processes and hone yours and the organization's civic engagement skills by learning what types of civic engagement designs are most successful for different types of situations.  As you get more skilled and the quality of your civic engagement increases so will the numbers who attend.  If you build your civic engagement design well around a topic people are truly concerned about then they will come.\nWhat are some simple learning pearls that you may want to share with others?\n\n",
