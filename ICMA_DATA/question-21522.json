  "text": "\n\nWe had a taxpayer who was demolishing an old out-building, (shed), and discovered very old dynamite and blasting caps.  This individual called our Sheriff's Dept and we were required to call the bomb squad, from an adjoining County, to properly dispose of the materials.  We sent the taxpayer a bill for the bomb squad's services and the taxpayer agreed to pay half.  \nWould anyone have policies applicable to this type of situation or similar?  If so can you please send them to me.\nThank you!\n\n",
