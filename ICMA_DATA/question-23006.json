The Y is a good partner because of their long term track record in recreation.  There should be some concern about a new private/non-profit if operations are part of the relationaship.  If their role is simply to fund raise and the city operates the facility that's a different matter.\n\n\nThere are a lot of good examples of city-YMCA public private partnerships where the Y builds and opereates facilities on city land.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Dubuque and the Dubuque Community School District are completing a feasibility study on a partnership for an aquatic center. Part of the study is how can this partnership work and what other partners could be included. Currently there are discussions with the Dubuque Community Y, Northeast Iowa Community College, Loras College, University of Dubuque and Clarke University. Not sure where this will all end up. \nA new 4,000 seat ice arena was built 3 years ago. This was built by a not-for-profit on city land. The city contributed some funds and the not-for-profit donated the project to the city upon completion. The city executed a management agreement with the not-for-profit and they now operate the facility. The USHL hockey team, Dubuque Fighting Saints, have won the national championship 2 of there first three years and they draw large crowds. Youth hockey is thriving. The not-for-profit has had some financial challenges, but they have continued to go it alone. \nAs far as creating a not-for-profit to do a project I would suggest a different approach. The city has partnered with the Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque on many programs and projects. You could partner with an existing not-for-profit and your local community foundation could manage a fundraising campaign.\nIf you would like any additional information you can contact me or Leisure Services Manager Marie Ware.\n\n\nThe City of Dubuque and the Dubuque Community School District are completing a feasibility study on a partnership for an aquatic center.
