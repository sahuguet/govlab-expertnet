I would recommend you talk to their administrator or assistant.  But as a result, most cities in the St. Louis County area reassessed their security measures.  We added a secured area behind our Council Chamber dais, and are also adding secured card-swipe access locks at all exterior points of entry/exit to each of our public buildings.\n\n\nKirkwood, Missouri went through a tragedy a couple of years ago involving a shooting at one of their city council meetings.

All entrances except one are keyed to employee ID cards.  One entrance, easily accessible to all (including those with disabilities), has a desk that is staffed by Durham One-Call personnel.  These highly-trained employees can answer most questions, give directions, and have nearly instant access to a uniformed Durham Police Officer who is present whenever City Hall is open.  All of us employees look out for visitors to provide them with service and assistance, but we also keep our eyes open for problems.  I believe this is working very well for us.\n\n\nCity of Durham, NC wants to ensure easy accessibility to all visitors, and to ensure both visitors and employees are safe.

      "text": "\n\nI have dealt with this same question in two different municipalities now and the advice already given is very solid.  It is probably a great idea to incorporate electronic door security as well as video camera technology that will be monitored by your police dispatch or police staff.  You should not get caught up in thinking that you cannot design a functionally secure and inviting space.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  In today's day and age with many people angry with government, it is important to provide a secure environment for our employees.  However, it is also incumbent upon local government to be available and accessible to the public.  The compromise here is that with the implementation of video surveillance and security card access, people looking to engage in bad behavior will think twice.\n\n\nI have dealt with this same question in two different municipalities now and the advice already given is very solid.
