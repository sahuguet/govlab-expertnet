Regarding format, I always like reports to be run at the end of a month as opposed to on the date of a meeting, I like to see a prior year to date corresponding revenue / expenditure figure.  For entity wide reports I sometime use an organization report that summarizes departments on one line.\n\n\nSeveral thoughts.

In this system, each department would export a budget vs. actual accompanied by explanatory narrative.  Does anyone have examples or recommended formats for this type of process? Thanks in advance for your responses.\n\n",
