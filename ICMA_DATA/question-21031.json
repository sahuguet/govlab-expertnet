As you\u2019ve noted in your question, most county or city code provisions regarding commercial and residential occupancy standards focus on room type and minimum square-footage per occupant. Occupancy standards must also fall in line with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (http://bit.ly/eSHYDQ) and the various regulatory handbooks (http://1.usa.gov/kVnBy6) issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. An excellent illustrated example of county-level regulations is Occupancy Standards in Montgomery County (http://bit.ly/lAgzIM), as presented by CASA DE MARYLAND. I was not able to find any information regarding non-room type or footage-based standards. Does anyone have any knowledge of such a regulatory scheme?\n\n\nThank you for this most interesting question.
