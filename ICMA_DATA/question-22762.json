ICMA has a few articles that discuss measurable outcomes from community appearance improvement efforts that may be of use to you. \n\u2022   \u201cPolice and Code Enforcement Collaboration\u201d is an article about Aurora, CO and their efforts to use police and community appearance improvement strategies to reduce crime in certain neighborhoods. They found that their program was successful and that the external appearance of a neighborhood and the level of crime are linked. icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/1808\n\u2022   The City of Durham has used Computerized Neighborhood Environment Tracking (ComNET) to clean up the appearance of their neighborhoods and improve city-citizen relationships. Citizens report nuisances with handheld computers with digital cameras to report issues to the local government and then the government takes care of these issues. This has resulted in a much improved appearance of the City. icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/100178\n\u2022   \u201cThe True Value of Code Enforcement in a Community\u201d is an article that discusses how code enforcement can be a driver of change in a community. You may find this article to be a good starting point for your research. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/305014/The_True_Value_of_Code_Enforcement_in_a_Community\nI hope these articles are helpful! Any other ICMA members please add your comments and advice!\nBest, \nRobin Saywitz\nICMA Knowledge Network Intern\nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Kathleen,\nThank you for your question on improving community appearance.
