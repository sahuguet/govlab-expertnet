I had always assumed the public sector operated the same way. Some state and federal agencies go several steps further and initiate background checks, so asking an applicant if he's been convicted of a non-traffic related crime seems to be a pretty mainstream practice. I'm not aware of any legal framework that prohibits this question from being asked by public employers. \nHere is an excellent article I was able to find on an applicants rights concerning arrests and convictions when applying for jobs:\nhttp://www.privacyrights.org/ar/rosencrim.htm\nYou might also want to contact someone at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to ask if there are any differences in this area when it comes to public versus private sector jobs. I would imagine that if there are differences it would be that public sector employers are expected to be even more diligent in asking about any prior criminal history than private sector employers. However, it's worth following up with them:\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/\nHope this is helpful.\nDerek Johnson\n\n\nKevin,\n\nI can't speak for city and town jobs, but nearly every private sector job I've applied for has asked some form of this question to prospective applicants.
