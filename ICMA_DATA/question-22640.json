Your scorecard gains legitimacy when internal and external data point the same way.\nDoes your zoning office track and cite blighted vacant properties? That's a good measure of internal activity, but it describes staff, not properties. That measure will show a spike in blight If the inspections team prioritizes certain work or gets extra staff.\nIf you have a regional association of realtors, it may be a great source of data. Real estate data may include own/rent stats, valuations, sale activity, and vacancy. This data may be kept quite current with market activity and could be shared with your team. You can also ask local realtors about buying subscriptions to certain databases.\nCensus and BLS data are updated more slowly but give the most authoritative answers. Depending on the size and population of your districts, the Census gives a baseline and the three-year American Community Survey update provides a checkpoint.\nLastly, school systems collect a fair amount of population data which might be fragmented from your office. Student enrollment (and demographics) isn't the same as total population change, but it tells an important related story and is updated annually with a precise count.\nOthers can weigh in with specific examples and links.

If so, what data sources (citizen surveys, sampling from existing data, etc) did you use to collect systematic data?\n\u2022Increase historic district home ownership to 40% \n\u2022Decrease vacant residential structures by 30%  \n\u2022Increase urban population by 2% (1,200) \nThanks!\nMercy Montgomery\nCity of Hamilton, OH\n\n",
