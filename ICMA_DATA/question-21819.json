Results of the studies will be published in leading academic and professional journals in the field and contribute to the advancement of the art and science of public administration.  The project has a very strict policy on privacy and voluntary participation and has been approved by the Rutgers IRB. \nTo join the panel, or for more information, please visit www.PSRPanel.org\nMirae Kim\nResearch Associate\nSchool of Public Affairs and Administration\nRutgers University\n\n",
