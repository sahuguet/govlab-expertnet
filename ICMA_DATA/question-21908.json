Once an animal has been selected for our adoption program a rescue group cannot take it unless the shelter pet has been in the adoption program for more than 14 days.  At that point we view the pet as languishing and will allow a PPP to take the animal.  We don\u2019t allow PPPs to adopt pets within the first 14 days they\u2019re here because we don\u2019t want them to take advantage of the shelters spay/neuter and medical services.  Some of the PPPs would wait until we\u2019d done everything for the pet and then adopt it.  We don\u2019t provide health checks, vaccinations, worming, spay/neuter or other medical care to PPPs, so we won\u2019t let PPPs \u2018game\u2019 the system by waiting until we\u2019ve done all of the expensive work and then take the pet for a small fee.  We don\u2019t have any problems with PPPs over this.  \nIf a PPP has committed to a shelter pet and a citizen subsequently expresses interest in adopting the pet, we advise them that the pet has already been spoken for.  We place a card on a PPP-selected pet\u2019s cage that identifies the pet as having already been adopted, so there is rarely a conflict.  The card does not identify the pet as having been selected by a PPP, so citizens simply move on to the next pet.  \nWhen we place \u201cholds\u201d on pets it\u2019s usually because we have an owner coming for the pet, or the pet is being held on a dangerous animal or cruelty charge.  We don\u2019t allow PPPs or citizens to place requests on animals being held on dangerous cases.   Occasionally, a PPP will express interest in such a pet, but citizens don\u2019t see those animals, so they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re here.   Any other \u201cholds\u201d would be treated in the same way strays are treated.  Once an animal is in the adoption program its first come/first served.   \nIf you would like further information, please contact our Animal Welfare Superintendant.\nCatherine English, Animal Welfare Superintendant\nThe City of Oklahoma City\n405.297.3088\ncatherine.english@okc.gov\n\n\nOur animal adoption priority policy is partly covered in our Transfer Agreement we have with rescue groups, which we call \u201cPet Placement Partners\u201d or \u201cPPPs\u201d.
