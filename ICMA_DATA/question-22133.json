  "text": "\n\nWe have several non-profit organizations that are in a capital campaign or will be starting a campaign.  Some invclude a senior community center, children's musuem, ice sheet,  and boys and girls club facility.  The City is often requested to be a public partner in the facility devlopemt (not operational costs).    I should note our city does not operate recreation service/programs; however, we look to community organizations to fill that role.  I am looking for examples of cities who assist with community livability/recreational facility projects, decision matrix used to determine the city's role and finacial partnership levels.\n\n",
