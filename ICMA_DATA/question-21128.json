  "text": "\n\nWe are a mid-sized city with a high degree of high quality automation and continue to pursue more ways to get more effectiveness from our staff through the use of software and hardware as \"force multipliers\". It has generally worked well, as we are meeting community needs fairly well with staffing levels that are either lean or extraordinarly lean depending on how you look at it. \nOne area we need to be mroe successful in is the organization of our IT function and the oversight of our IT purchasing and long term concept. We do not do as well as we should with deconflicting, coordinating, or takign advantages of software strengths as we add adjacent or new layers of systems. It becomes hard to decide if we need version 15 of product A for Finance, the upgrade to software B for Parks & Rec, or if we should make a slightly risky investment for a potentially high return in police for software C.  We aren't even talking about the incomplete work or bug fixes we don't have time to complete from initial installation of software D two years ago....\nWho feels like they have a great organization and oversight that prioritizes well? How do organizations compete for the resources, and who keeps it all together in a way that makes sense over time?\nWho has a great system that works well?\nThanks\n\n",
