You can read about it here: http://buildingdialogue.wordpress.com/about-our-civic-health-diagnostic-workbook/\nThe workbook is intended to be self-guiding although we also provide supporting facilitation and training services.  Another source with good assessment questions is \"Civic Fusion: Mediating Polarized Public Disputes.\"  We have a number of other tools relating to communications on a team.  If you want to send me an email at info@buildingdialgoue.com with more specifics I may be able to recommend other resources.\n\n\nPenny - Not sure what type of communications you want to assess but we have recently published a workbook for local governments to be used with employees and external stakeholders to help communities evaluate readiness for collaborative civic engagement (communications is one component).
