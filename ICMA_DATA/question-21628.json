  "text": "\n\nGood morning - My name is Bill Holland, Director of Bldg, Permitting & Inspections for the City of Salisbury, MD.  Yesterday I was a participant in a webinar on performance measures. I need clarification on several performance measures prior to compiling the required information, they are as follows:\nA. Building permits issued; will this be \"total\" permits (building, plumbing, demolition, signs, etc.)?\nB. Permitting hours paid; will this be just hour paid to my permit processor or will this include permit processor, plans examiner, inspections?\nC.  Permitting expenditures; does this include the total department budget or just monetary expenses to issue a permit, such as permitting processor, plans examiner, etc.? Does this expenditure only include salary and benefits or do I attempt to figure in other costs, i.e., office supplies, software, and other supplies needed to support their position/s?  \nThanks for your time,\nBill Holland\n\n",
