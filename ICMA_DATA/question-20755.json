I haven't read it and ICMA doesn't endorse it, but it seems to be related to the kind of information you're looking for: http://www.neal-schuman.com/bdetail.php?isbn=1555704824\nHere's a short piece on the Brooklyn Public Library, which claims to be the only public library to have a a full-time office devoted to senior citizens: http://www.publiclibrariesonline.org/content/senior-program-grows-brooklyn-brooklyn-public-librarys-service-aging\nI've also been in contact with ICMA and AFI about tracking down some additional resources for you. If I hear back about anything promising I will post it here. Good luck with your research.\n\n\nDiantha,\n\nDon't know if you've found this in the course of your research yet, but here is a link for \"Serving Seniors\" and handbook for \"planning and delivering library services\" to senior citizens.

  "text": "\n\nI am researching emerging practices for library services that meet the needs of boomers and other active older adults  -- services that reflect the diversity of needs and interests of older adults and that break out of the traditional models of senior services.   My research is for a book to be published by ALA Editions titled 50+ Library Services:  Innovations in Action.   I would especially like to profile some innovative work involving partnerships between libraries and municipalities that demonstrate new approaches to working with older adults who are not dependent and infirm, but who seek to learn, to serve, to create and to connect.    As innovators, I am hoping that you will be able to point me to some instructive examples - in your library or your community, or elsewhere.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n",
