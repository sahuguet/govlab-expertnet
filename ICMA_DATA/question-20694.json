      "text": "\n\nDear Ms. Freeman:  McHenry County, IL has created a financial structure that combines an Assoc. County Administrator- Finance, whose primary responsibility is (i) budgeting and (ii) measuring the periodic performance of the county's financial performance, together with a county auditor, who is primarily responsible for accounts payable, and an HR Director who is responsible for tracking county employees and managing the county's wage and grade compensation system.  The payroll process (managing ADP) is managed by the Assoc. Cty Administrator in conjunction with the HR Dept.   The County Board has established key policies to support its financial management including the adoption of an annual budget policy, a policy requiring the county to maintain a 5 month cash reserve; and, a debt policy for the issuance of bonds or debt certificates.  The linchpin in the county's financial management structure is the financial model that I created to allow the county to measure the impact of its financial decisions before they are made.  The financial model tracks all county revenues and expenses, including a 5 year rolling capital expediture plan, and measures spendind decisions against fund balances over a five year future forward looking timeframe.\nThere is, of course, much more to this financial process including managing sources of county revenues, such as levy revenues and variable revenues from fines and fees.  This is the province of the Board's Assoc. Cty. Admin. for Finance who worked under my leadership as the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the County Board.  The Finance and Audit Committee is responsible for creating and managing policies pertaining to county finances.  It also includes incorporating the county's strategic planning document into a priority of spending for programs and the annual county audit to ascertain how well the county is managing to abide by GASB and other internal financial controls.\n\n\nDear Ms. Freeman:  McHenry County, IL has created a financial structure that combines an Assoc.

      "text": "\n\nI've worked for two localities that are set up differently.\n(1) In the first, there is a Finance Department that includes: Accounting, HR, IT, County Records, Purchasing, Risk Management, Taxes, and Treasury. The Office of Management and Budget is located in the County Manager's Department (supervised by the County Manager). And, finally, the Auditor is hired and supervised by the County Commission directly. (2) The Finance Department in the other location includes: Accounting, Budget Office, Payroll, Investments, Cash Mgmt, Risk Mgmt and financial duties for other funds like Water and Sewer. The Auditor's Office is in the County Manager's Department and is supervised by the County Manager.\nI prefer the Budget Office being under the County manager because it's such a strategic office. However, I also like it (from a managerial perspective) when the budget office, finance department, and Audit office are all under different departments or areas of responsibility. This really kept each office that was closely related (Budget, Finance, Audit) on their toes. If all of these offices are \"too close\" it creates an atmosphere in which it's easier to miss things that should not be missed. \nAll of that aside, you should also take into account any State laws that may prescribe where and how certain local offices are structured and supervised. Some State laws micromanage more than others.\n\n\nI've worked for two localities that are set up differently.\n(1) In the first, there is a Finance Department that includes: Accounting, HR, IT, County Records, Purchasing, Risk Management, Taxes, and Treasury.
