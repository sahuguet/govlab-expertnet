  "text": "\n\nOur city has a large TID that includes a retail/commercial area. We recently received an offer for a retail development that included a right of first refusal for four lots to the west of where their new development would be.  They would like the ROFR to be for an indefinite period of time.  My question is do you know of any communities that accept ROFR in retail/commercial areas?  Has it worked?  This seems like a deal breaker for us.  Even though the development is much needed and would generate funds for a TIF, it would significantly limit future development.  Any other ideas on things we could offer in exchange for ROFR?\n\n",
