  "text": "\n\nHay people!  I have never posted prior to today so if I\u2019m not posting in the right place or doing something wrong please let me know.  I\u2019m the (NEW) Town Manager in Tazewell, Virginia.  The present Insurance that the Town has is not with VML yet.  I am prepared to address this issue soon however right now I am mainly looking for a draft News Paper ad for the emergency services employees Insurance.  The Town is presently insured by Nation Wide with another Rider who carries the emergency services employees Insurance.  I know I don\u2019t have to run an AD if I am switching to VML but in order to be respectful to the present provider I feel it\u2019s best to do Sealed bids.   Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
