I would recommend contacting them to see if they can help with your specific questions. \nSeattle Department of Transportation \n(206) 684-7583 \nWalkAndBike@Seattle.gov \nHope this helps!

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Wilsonville is interested in the viability of a pedestrian crossing flag program at street crossings that do not quality for additional traffic slowing devices.   (Buckets of bright flags available to pedestrians at each side of a crossing)     \nBefore creating a pilot for this, we are interested in:    1)  how are crossing sites selected for the flag program?      2)  what department manages the flag program?    3)  what liability does the city incur when promoting and/or supplying such a program?    4)   are the flags always at crossings that include a marked crosswalk?\nThank you,\nPeggy Watters\nCommunity Services Director\n\n",
