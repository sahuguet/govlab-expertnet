  "text": "\n\nOur county is attempting to migrate toward a performance based pay system. We have realistic expectations and want to take a positive first step forward next year (formal evaluations, some type of rating system that is tied to salary adjustments). I have reviewed a number of performance appraisal/employee evaluation examples and to be honest I find many to be overly sophisticated, perhaps prepared and packaged by consutlants.\nDoes anyone know of any good examples, designed for local government organizations, that introduce performance as a factor in pay decisions, without being overly complex and academic?\n\n",
