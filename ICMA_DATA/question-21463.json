  "text": "\n\nThe City of Sierra Vista would like to know if other communities have employed cost-effective cameras that are used for monitoring areas in which grafitti appears periodically.  We invested in a camera several years ago for over $5,000 that never worked the way it was supposed to.  The vendor has not been helpful in getting it to working order.  A suggestion has been made internally to consider cameras such as those sold inexpensively via Cabellos or other mainstream vendors (around $100 apiece).  But before we do, we would be very interested to hear if other communities have successful used similar technology.  Thanks!\n\n",
