If you want broader engagement you have to make the process interesting, exciting, and rewarding.  Generally, public meetings have a bad name, particularly since people go to City Council meetings (often the only interaction they can have with local governance) and find out that they are incredibly boring and most of the decisions have already been made.  I think a good example of innovative and ongoing engagement can be found here: http://www.manorlabs.org/.  The key here is to build a relationship with members of your community instead of trying to have a meeting and hoping people show up.  By showing people that you are interested in hearing what they have to say and that you will act on the things they want to see happen, you can build trust and increase your community's interest in engaging.\nAlthough we don't focus directly on the problem of gathering greater levels of engagement, you may be interested in a series of blog posts we wrote on Structuring Public Engagement: http://buildingdialogue.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/structuring-engagement-series/\n\n\nGetting people engaged can be difficult, particularly if your only method of engagement is the standard public meeting.
