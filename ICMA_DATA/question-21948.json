A state-of-the-art LMS will essentially do five things, all online. Register people for classes, manage licenses and certificates, store training records, deliver online content (eLearning), and manage first level evaluations. We do not have the system installed yet so we have no experience with it but we are using three different systems for those five functions. Colleagues who have LMS's have commented that they are \"wonderful\" once you work out the bugs and learn how to use them. Our system is called TrainingPartner (brochure attached) and if you do a web search for \"learning management system\" you'll find bunches of them.\n\n\nThe Sonoma County Human Services Department just purchased a learning management system (LMS) that will do that and much more.
