The City began the process with a citywide needs assessment process that included current business process mapping as a means of generating the RFP requirements.

The City originally contracted for some business process optimization consulting as well but there was no bandwidth to include that along with the implementation effort.

As a first pass the City challenged functional representatives to define what the system needed to deliver/output and not how it would do it.

I served as project manager for our ERP solution for core financials, HR, PY and purchasing system that we implemented in 2003 & 2004.  We used GFOA consulting services and selected Sungard Bi-Tech IFAS (now ONESolution) as our product.  I highly encourage a needs assessment and getting clear direction up from of where you want to go, not focus on just what you do right now.\n\n\nI agree with Valerie's comments about the need for a consulant if your staff has limited experience with an ERP selection and implementation.

The company was called Rapidigm, and the person was Eric Von Stromberg, who I don't believe is doing consulting any more. Eric was outstanding. \nA separate word of advice: Software vendors and their implementation team will go to great lengths to tell you they can set up their software any way you want - they want to make you a happy customer and will configure things any way you want. \nIt is normal that your team will try and recreate what they had before, because that's what they know, they're comfortable with it, and probably not many have experience working outside of that system. That is human nature, and also the path of least resistance. \nThe key here is that you don't know or understand the full capabilities of their system. You also probably won't understand the process flows that the programmers used to design the software. \nBefore you start any implementation work hard to make your vendor define what constitutes \"best practices\" for making their system work, from one end to another. Don't dismiss their approach based on your existing systems. \nAlso remember that your finance personnel will focus on accuracy and accountability. They will also be heavily influenced on their monthly work processes. But the real power of an ERP system lies in effecting better organizational management, not just improving the accounting system. Make the best decisions you can on improving management, and improved accounting will follow as a matter of course. \nLastly, look deeply at the stock reports. Make sure that an average person can run a report without having to be a subject matter expert. Make sure the reports are readable and present appropriate information. And make sure reports let to get down to low level details when needed. And remember that whatever you buy, you will almost certainly have to develop a lot of new reports to handle the specifics of your organization.\n\n\nWe did a replacement almost 10 years ago and use a neutral consultant on both RFP development, contract development, and implementation.

We would like to know how other cities have approached this, specifically with the use of a consultant(s).  To what extent was a consultant involved (needs analysis, solicitation, selection, implementation)?  Did they perform business analysis (including future needs) and business optimization?  Were you happy with them?  What was the name of the company?  If you could do it over, what would you change?\n\n",
