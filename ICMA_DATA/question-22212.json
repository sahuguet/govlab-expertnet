  "text": "\n\nI am formulating a Masters capstone paper around a comparison of forms of government based mainly on bond rating (fairly simplistic I know).  If possible I would like to look at cities that have changed their government structure from Mayor-Council to Council-Manager and vice versa to see if bond ratings or fiscal policies changed at all in a period of about 5 years around the change.  Anyway, I need to find 10-20 cities that have changed their government structure in the last decade and I was hoping that some of you out there would be able to throw out a few names to look at.  I appreciate any assistance and welcome any suggestions.  Thanks!\n\n",
