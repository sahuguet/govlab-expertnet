This time is worth its weight in gold in opening the doors of communication with your community, being transparent, showing that government is not an ogre (but rather human), and reaching a wider range of demographics.  Staff time could also be saved by 1) instead of a news release for everything that happens, the amount can be reduced to \"major\" events, and 2) putting infromation on social media, say...a road closure...will let people know about it on their phones, at home, at work...and reduce the amount of angry phone calls staff receives.\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean by fear of hackers: I remember it was something that was trendy in the 90's and is now more limited to a few people being malicious towards big company servers.\nSocial networking is not a fashion trend that will be gone tomorrow.  Sure, the company names may change and it will evolve - but the way people are receiving their information is changing into quick, short bursts.  Do you want people getting that information from you?....someone else?....not at all?....or manipulated by the press?\n\n\n@Erin, inappropriate comments can easily be addressed with action taken based on set policies and staff time comes down to about 10 - 15 minutes per day.

Typically people are willing to embrace a new technology if they can see that it brings value to them.  Richard has some great points in his response as well.  Another great selling point for many leaders is when they see how many of their peer cities or counties are embracing a new tool.\n\n\nErin -- in our session tomorrow we're going to talk about how you can demonstrate the value that social media can bring to an organization.
