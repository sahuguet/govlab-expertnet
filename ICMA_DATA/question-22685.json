ICMA has a guideline for the Code of Ethics that says that \"Each member should commit at least 40 hours per year to professional development activities that are based on the practices identified by the members of ICMA.\" Based on this, I think you would be safe to assume a minimum of 40 hours of professional development should be expected of professionals supporting the County Executive office.\n\n\nHi Leslie.

      "text": "\n\nI've always found that staff truly appreciate and enjoy the time that employers provide for professional development.  Can you describe the type of professionals you are working with? \nA thing to keep in mind is that professional development can mean different things to different leaders.  I once consulted for an exec of an organization who, during regular weekly staff meetings of 30 minutes, would use 20 minutes and do a quick exercise of team building.  He apparently fell in love with a management book and wanted everyone to follow it and considered what he was providing to be 'professional development'.   \nThere were so many things wrong with the scenario: he wasn't open to feedback, he tried to teach in bits and pieces that really didn't feel complete, the training had an almost cult like feel of \"do it this way or your fired\".  It was so awful, that not one of 25 staff I anonymously surveyed found it beneficial, it was eventually dropped.  If it's real professional development, make it meaningful and consistent and try to outsource it. Also, please don't demand that your employees respond to email while at a training unless it's mission critical or an emergency, Ive seen that as well - it's horrible, you might as well just be back in the office working.\n\n\nI've always found that staff truly appreciate and enjoy the time that employers provide for professional development.

We are reviewing our strategic priorities and trying to determine our capacity for this next fiscal year. We want to make sure we allocate enough time for staff professional development.  I am thinking that between 60 - 80 yrs/year should be assumed and then staff could devote additional time on their own.  By professional development I mean the full spectrum, from individual reading and research, to webinars, working with a mentor, and attending classes.\n\n\nThanks Fred - we are the Analysts and support staff in the County executive office.

      "text": "\n\nLeslie, That's sounds like a very nice package you are offering your team, congrats on being thoughtful to your staff!  I've always thought about professional development for analyst type positions to be at least an hour a week, so about 52 hours a year.  Technical folks usually need  (and really want) much more training.   I think you are on the right track.  Have you provided this type of incentive in the past?  The reason I ask is that I've seen very well intentioned leaders start these types of projects, and it looses the drive in a few months because everyone gets busy.  Who keeps track of hours? Is it mandatory? Is it all on your own, or a mix of group/peer training and individual?\n\n\nLeslie, That's sounds like a very nice package you are offering your team, congrats on being thoughtful to your staff!
