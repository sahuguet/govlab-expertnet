  "text": "\n\nI am looking for information about the nature and prevalence of oral public comment in local deliberative bodies (e.g. zoning boards, county commissions, etc.) nationwide. I hope to find out what percentage of bodies guarantee their citizens the right to speak at meetings, and to find out what types of bodies most often extend these speaking rights/privileges. \nPlease let me know if you have any research that addresses this question (or questions similar to it). I also hope to complete my project within the next few days; please try to answer my question as soon as you can.\n\n",
