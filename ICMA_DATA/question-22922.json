(http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/303904/Strategic_Communications_Plan) \nThis plan outlines and justifies a robust communications program, and it gets down to the nuts and bolts of your question when it begins to discuss the \u201ccommunity liaison\u201d on page 41 of the pdf file.
