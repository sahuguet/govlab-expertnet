  "text": "\n\nHello Group:\nMy name is Justin Kohls and I am a MPA student at DePaul University in Chicago. I am beginning research for my capstone project and wanted to survey this forum and see if there are any current data sets on ethical behavior/attitudes/beliefs among city managers.   I will be using a mixed-methods approach for this research, compiling quantitative data with key informant interviews to find out if there are strong characteristic differences between governments classified on a scaled variable of ethics.\nMy research is set to build off of the following study: Menzel, Donald C. (1992). Ethics Attitudes and Behaviors in Local Governments: An Empirical Analysis. State & Local Government Review,  Autumn 1992, 94-102., but focus solely on City Managers/Assistant Managers.  In the event that I cannot locate a data set, I will be disseminating a survey to compile my own data set, but wanted to check here first and see what might be out there.\nAdditionally, if any of you know of any prior research related to this, it would be much appreciated if you could send it my way.\nI can be reached through here or at jkohls@mail.depaul.edu,\nThank you in advance,\nJustin Kohls\n(612) 600-6228\n\n",
