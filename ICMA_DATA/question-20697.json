(but put it this way: if you're rejected by an organization that operates that way, maybe you don't want to work for them. )  I learned my management skills in the private sector myself, and I've also hired plenty of people from the private sector.  With the job market the way it is these days, though, whatever sector one is in currently, an applicant needs to set him-/herself apart.\nWhat I would look for is the motivation behind wanting to work for my city---not just the public sector, but why here, why our community?  The plain truth is, skills aside, working for the public sector is very different than the private sector and comes with an entirely different set of expectations, and each community is unique.  An applicant needs to understand this, demonstrate that knowledge and show the willingness to embrace it.   In short, I would want to make sure that you want to come to the public sector--to my city--for the right reasons.  \np.s.  personal comment: I've noticed myself over time looking at cover letters and resumes no differently than the application as far as importance: they are a requirement and not much more.  The only way they will stand out to me, honestly, is if they are really bad.  As long as you spell everything correctly (I CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS), have all the names right, and provide decent information, I will read it once or twice, set it aside, and put all the focus on how you are going to wow me in the interview.\n\n\nI am one of those people who doesn't care what sector you're in now, and I also agree that the old school model of checking the HR boxes needs to go away.

      "text": "\n\nA real challenge is getting past screening processes. At times, either by policy or necessity to deal with volume, we delegate too much to human resources. I think this is more a challenge in medium to large organizations, but perfectly qualified people don't make the next round because their resume or application doesn't meet the job description to the letter. The skills and abilities I have may be perfectly transferable to the job to which I am applying, but I earned those skills in the private rather than public sector so therefore am not eligible.  Process analysts aren't empowered or trained to think outside the box, and reject the applicant because, \"the job description says we need X, and the applicant doesn't have X listed.\" This can be a problem even at the interview stage. The most successful interviews I've had were when I spoke directly with the manager with whom I'd be working, and not a hiring agent.\nYou might call the contact for a position you're interested in and see if you can get information on what the process is for reviewing files and interviewing candidates, and shoot for those that seem more open. You have a good background in local government already, so that should help get through some of the flags.\n\n\nA real challenge is getting past screening processes.
