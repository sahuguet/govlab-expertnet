  "text": "\n\nHello,\nThe City of Dublin is going to do a network vulnerability/penetration test sometime next year. This is essentially where a firm that tries to hack into the City network to test the level of security. \nI was inquiring if any other communities have done such a test?  If you have, would be possible to contact you and converse about your experience?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\nThank you,\nTimothy Blakeslee\n\n",
