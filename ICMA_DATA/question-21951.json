  "text": "\n\nHave any city managers signed the paperwork for their own bonus without going to their council or commission for approval?  Was the bonus outlined in your contract?  Did you rely on the personnel policy to allow you to do so? \nOur city manager's contract does not specify a bonus, however, the personnel policy does allow for one if the employee obtains a superior or outstanding evaluation rating and the funds are budgeted in the department in which they work.  The city manager rating fell between marginal and satisfactory yet she signed for not only a bonus for herself but for the finance director who signs the paperwork also.  To be \"fair\" all other employees, no matter the evaluation rating though, got a bonus also which is not in line with the policy.  What good is a Commission approved policy if it is not followed??  Also, the bonus funds were not budgeted in each department but under another general department as a lump sum which was never specifically discussed by the CM at the budget workshop as it was added last minute.  Minutes were reviewed to determine if Commission waived the policy or approved the bonuses but they did not.  I know it takes more than a quick snippet of facts but just looking at the fact of not going to the Commission for approval of her own bonus - Do you all think this can be considered mismanagement of public funds?\n\n",
