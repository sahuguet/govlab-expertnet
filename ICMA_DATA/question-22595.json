When I saw your question, I thought of Peter Block and some of his philosophy on community building.  Peter advocates welcoming people to a meeting with food--even just cookies and coffee--and allowing some networking time to occur.  We do that in our homes when invite people over.  Do any of us ever think about that for our local government meetings. . .especially those where we are really trying to engage the public?\n\n\nHi Ray!

All too often, meeting in public, while essential, can be inconvenient for members of the public. Also, the kinds of in-person meetings that take place follow conventions that are not familiar to many people such as those found in a council meeting.  \nI'd like to suggest that hospitality starts with making it convenient for the public to participate and that the online environment is the perfect place to host a community conversation for members of the public.  \nOpen Town Hall (http://www.opentownhall.com) makes it easy for government agencies to host members of the public in a community conversation. The platform allows local governments to choose the topics that are important to the community; monitor comments to ensure civility; and provide information about the topic.  \nMost critical, a good government host doesn't only provide a place for conversation but communicates in return. This is done by informing the citizen about the outcome of important local issues once a decision has been made. After all, how effective would it be to invite people to a birthday party without the person who was having the birthday attending? If you're going to invite people to engage in local government, the most hospitable thing you can do is to make them feel that they were part of the decision making process.\n\n\nHospitality is important and should be part of engagement.
