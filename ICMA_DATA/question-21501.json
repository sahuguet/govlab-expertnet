      "text": "\n\nBobby\nSome suggestions for you.  Most utility organizations will send you their rules and regulations or ordinances that define what is required.  However, as a former utility director, the best approach to addressing your questions are these:\na) cleanouts are best used in most communities as a preventive maintenance approach to keeping a sewer lateral clear if they get plugged.  It's also an an avenue to send a camera down to assess what a blockage may entail. \nb) In new developments, this should be a requirement.  In older areas, offering a grant to install or subsidizing installation have been used to encourage this.  \nc) responsibility for sewer laterals varies by community.  Generally, its suggested that from the curb to the main is the utility's problem, and from the curb to the home is the homeowners problem.  The utility can agree to repair a failure on a lateral and charge back the cost based on a set hourly rate per employee, parts and equipment used.  Or the homeowner can contract for the repair after the utility has located the problem.  This is good customer service. \nd) flapper valves installed on sewer laterals in the home just before it leaves the basement or crawl space, are easy to install by a plumber.  These are best used in areas where historically, backups occur.  \nFinally, a comprehensive set of rules and regulations that a city ordinance adopts as the standard guide for all to use I have found to aid in consolidating the information into one document and not spread through an ordinance book.  \nGood luck,\nBill Gilmore\nWilliam B.
