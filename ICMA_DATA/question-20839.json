Like all libraries, we are experimenting with ways to meet demand for computers by job seekers, social service users, students and e-mail users. We use an automated PC Reservation system to assign and limit computer use. All our branches have wireless WiFi computer access for patrons with laptops. This somewhat reduces demand for library computers. Some of our branches are experimenting with using  library laptop computers for in-house training, and also for use by patrons doing lengthy online testing or applications. At our Main Library, we have a Computer Center which we open to public when not in use for training.

      "text": "\n\nAt Mesa Public Library (AZ), we have a time limit of one hour whether you have a library card or a guest pass.  We sell guest passes for $1.  For those who are doing online testing, we have a proctoring service which helps us make arrangements if the test lasts longer than 1 hour.  For those in search of jobs, at our branches, we have several \"research\" computers which are not timed.  We steer those in the job search mode here so they can find leads or create resumes.  However, they have to go back to a timed computer to submit online applications.  At the Main Library, we recently created a Career Center where we have computers just for those engaged in job search related activities.  This area is staffed to ensure that patrons are using it for job search, resume writing, online applications, etc.  We've partnered with local agencies to find the volunteers to staff the center and to provide the resources.  Before the Career Center, we did like Palm Beach and opened our training room for several hours twice a month with librarians in the room to help those who needed additional computer time for job search related activities. More information on our Career Center is available at http://www.mesalibrary.org/research/links/careercenter.aspx\n\n\nAt Mesa Public Library (AZ), we have a time limit of one hour whether you have a library card or a guest pass.

  "text": "\n\nOur Library staff is involved with increasing computer use by people needing to apply online for jobs, people lacking internet use at home and people travelling through as well as students with projects.  Has anyone found a way to alleviate pressure of time on staff and number of computers in the Library?  If you use computer kiosks outside the Library, how much do they cost? where do you place them? who pays for and maintains them?\n\n",
