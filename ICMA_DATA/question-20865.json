      "text": "\n\nWhile I was an elected County Auditor, I had records both paper, and microfiche dating back to the 1850's. I had newspapers that were bound but were crumbling back to the early 1900's. We digitized all of these records approximately 1 million records. We contracted with a vendor Aptitude Solutions as part of our upgrade to a new recording software management system. It took about 11 months for the conversion, but it was well worht it. Once we digitized all of the records, we handed all of the records older than 20 years to our Washington Secretary of State's Archives division. \nThey were able to safeguard the original documents and we had digitized images for people to review and look at.\nYou must get a vendor you trust, even if they are the high bidder, in digitizing, we found there are a lot of fly-by night operations out there. Server space was a problem, take whatever you think and your vendor thinks will be your server space necessary and triple it. Trust me you will thank me on this.\nGood luck!\n\n\nWhile I was an elected County Auditor, I had records both paper, and microfiche dating back to the 1850's.
