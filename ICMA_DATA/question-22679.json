Underground utility upgrades were the biggest expense, but they took the opportunity to make major surface and streetscape improvements. There was a lot of consultation with local business to inform the project plan, and work was planned for wintertime, to be completed before a major spring festival, with deadline incentives for contractors. Before the main street project began, street improvements were done on the parallel alley, and some businesses reversed their facades. While the main work was underway, the sidewalks mostly stayed open, and the wooden construction barriers were painted or muralized to add some interest. City staff sent regular emails and press releases with percentage status updates.   \nLinks:  \nhttp://www.oldtownwinchesterva.com/about-old-town/contact/ \nhttp://www.winchesterva.gov/utilities/loudoun-street-project\nAlso the Economic Development Director and the Public Services Director. I lived and worked in the downtown area while planning was underway but left before major work started. I received city newsletters with project updates and can forward those emails as examples of public communication, if that's helpful.  \nGood luck!\n\n\nWinchester, VA (26,000) recently completed a major renovation of its downtown pedestrian mall.
