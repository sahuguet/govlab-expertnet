Additionally, the City has an agreement with the YMCA.  The City owns the building and leases it to the local Y.  They are required to maintain the facility, provide the equipment, and pay the operating cost.  All City employees are allowed to use the facility.  The only cost is the Social Security value of the benefit.  Our Police civilian employees are free to use the facility at the Police Headquarters building.  Our Fire civilian employees are able to use the equipment at either the Police Headquarters Building or at any of the Fire Stations.   The program has been well received by our employees and occasionally does receive some comments from the Public.  The City Council has stated that it is part of our overall health and fitness program.  Employees who are healthy have fewer lost days due to sickness and injury.  Employees who are on workers compensation and are in rehab often use these facilities as part of their rehabilitation rather than going to a private facility.   The Physical Therapist will often come to our facility to provide the treatment.\n\n\nPort Orange, Florida has equipment in each of our Fire Stations and at our Police Headquarters Building.

      "text": "\n\nI worked for a local government that spent $100,000 on building a fitness center that was shared by employees of Transportation, Solid Waste, and Public Works.  It was funded by general tax revenues.  Police and Fire each had their own fitness centers for several years.   I never heard any complaints from the public about this being a \"perk.\"  If we had, the answer would of been that these employees performed very physical work and we needed them  in top physical shape.  The only complaints we ever got were from employees in other Departments that didn\u2019t have access to these facilities.  All employees were eligible for a reduced membership at the YMCA.   \nI worked for another local government that had a very modest fitness center.  Some of the initial funding came from the \u201cSafety and Wellness fund\u201d that was funded through tax revenues.  But the bulk of funds came from a $25 annual fee that employees paid to use the facility.  The justification for that program was that it would reduce obesity and thereby insurance costs.  That savings never materialized.  The facility was used mostly be employees who were already in good health and just appreciated the convenience of having a location at work.\n\n\nI worked for a local government that spent $100,000 on building a fitness center that was shared by employees of Transportation, Solid Waste, and Public Works.
