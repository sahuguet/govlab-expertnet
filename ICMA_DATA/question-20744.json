He then goes into steps he took to break down and present the importance of sustainability in order to galvanize his community into action. There are definitely elements of marketing principles for sustainability to be found here: http://bit.ly/g9xlGO\nThis article by Randall Reed discusses how ICMA members drew inspiration from the Federalist Papers-originally drafted to persuade New Yorkers to embrace and ratify the constitution-and modeled a similar set of papers with the purpose of explaining the moral imperative of sustainable practices. This piece may not give you direct marketing guidance (i.e. do x, y and z when setting up your media outreach plan), but it does establish the philosophical underpinnings of the importance of sustainability that will be crucial to any effective marketing plan: http://bit.ly/dGtLeT\nHere is a sample/guidelines for implementing a sustainability plan. It discusses best practices in marketing, stakeholder outreach and communication of a sustainability plan, and done so in an easy-to-read format: http://bit.ly/e2INEd\nAlso, I don't know if this is quite what you're looking for, but I was able to find a marketing and communication plan for the UC Berkeley Office of Sustainability. I'm not especially well-versed in the differences between sustainability plans for local governments  versus a university, but after going through it I do think there is some useful overlap in terms of  the guidelines and advice they provide: http://bit.ly/euu0ex\nGood luck. I hope that one or more of these documents helps your member in developing her own plan.\n\n\nPamela, \n\nDon't know if you've run across these examples in your search yet:\n\nHere is an article by Michael Willis, a municipal manager in the UK who found he had difficulty selling sustainability policies as a priority to his community.
