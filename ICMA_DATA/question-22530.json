The Board has been a real positive to help in accreditation efforts, the passage of a dedicated public safety sales tax and on-going oversight of the tax, and a forum for policy issues - which also includes animal control and traffic.\n\n\nJames, our population is around 53,000.

  "text": "\n\nWe are going to be discussing with our City Council whether a Public Safety Commission would be a constructive way to improve the amount and kind of information that is provided to the community regarding crime, safety, policing, etc.  This is not a Civil Service Commission or anything along those lines.  Nor, as we understand it, is the possible commission intended to be an oversight or citizen review committee for police activity/complaints.  And while the there is an interest in including fire and emergency management as part of the purview, the primary driver is police, crime and safety.\nI\u2019m curious to know if any of you have a similar commission.  Please share what the commission\u2019s purpose is; the types of issues/discussions it has; and, your own impression of whether it is positively contributing to your community\u2019s public safety mission.\nEspecially interested in hearing from diverse communities with population 50,000 - 100,000.\n\n",
