  "text": "\n\nCurrently, our water/sewer workers who have mandated after-hours/on-call status recieve .25 cents extra per hour for weeks that they are on-call, for a total of $32 extra dollars a week.  If they receive any callouts, they are for a minimum of 2 hours at overtime rate.  Just wondering how other organizations handle these type of work situations.  Thanks for any information you can offer.\n\n",
