  "text": "\n\nA decline in City revenues has decreased our resources for sidewalk cleaning and other services in the downtown area.  We want to engage the business owners in finding solutions to keeping the downtown area looking inviting.   The CRA covers the downtown area, the Chamber of Commerce is located downtown and the merchants have also organized a Downtown Cultural Alliance to promote events in the downtown area to attract visitors.  The City relationship with these three groups is not as strong as it could be but we are very interested in changing that dynamic.\n\n",
