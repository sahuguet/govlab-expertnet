The Albanian government has passed a law on territorial planning which requires each municipality to produce a land use plan for its  territory, to be incorporated into a nationwide land use plan. We expect that USAID will ask for proposals to help the new national agency dealing with comprehensive planning to assist local governments in planning, and to gather  the 300+ local plans for incorporation into the national planning document.\n\n\nDear Mr. Kece, \nWe don't have complete information yet, but it is likley that there soon will be a request for proposals for a local governance project in Albania.
