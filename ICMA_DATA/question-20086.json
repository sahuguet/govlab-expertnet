So we've been doing a lot of capital acquisitions using leftover funds at end-of-year, especially with all the position freezing we're doing.  The justification is simply keeping necessary equipment in working order to prevent excessive repiar costs and unforeseen emergency replacement needs, as well as staff safety.  If upfront purchases are too rich, towns can consider lease-purchases or issuing notes for bundled large equipment & vehicle investments if they end up getting too far behind and the replacement needs exceed what the operating budget could ever handle.  Having working plows and police cars and fire apparatus are very visible public services that are important to residents, so it makes political sense as well as administrative sense to not let the capital budget fall too desperately behind, because as you know, with incremental budgeting once you cut some piece of the budget back, it's VERY hard to ever build it back up without eliminating some other big ticket item or jacking up taxes beyond what anyone's comfortable with.\n\n\nIn the town I work for, like many towns, the capital budget gets hit hard when the council is looking to balance the budget.

How is your jurisdiction dealing with the issue of capital acquisitions in the current economic climate?
