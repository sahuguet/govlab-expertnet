      "text": "\n\nHi Greg,\nYes, and it is not easy.  What I have experienced is our folks are so busy preparing for the activity or providing that servce, they rarely have the time or even think about the need to \"communicate\" the event, or even have the skill set to undertake that task. To help overcome, that we created a dedicated team of communication experts who are responsible for applying all of the communications vehicles that are available, including social media.  In turn, staff evaluations now include a component on communications.  That drives everyone to develop \"calendars\" to promote their activity or event.  As nothing is worse to work your tale off to put together an event and have no one show up.  Our website provider is Civics Plus and that is the calendar tool we use externally.  Internally, we use Outlook and Sharepoint to schedule tasks associated with an event or activity.\nOnce you clearly establish the value of communications and who is responsible and accountable for that component, you will be amazed how well it works.  That first hump is a tough one though.\n\n\nHi Greg,\nYes, and it is not easy.
