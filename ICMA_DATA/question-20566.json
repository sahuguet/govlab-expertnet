  "text": "\n\nCurrently the City of Sugar Land has an open commercial solid waste system and is considering a closed system. What are typical franchise fees for a city that serves around 85,000 people? This would allow us to audit one or few companies instead of the 20 plus companies we currently have permitted! Any and all information is greatly appreciated!\nThanks,\nShaun\n\n",
