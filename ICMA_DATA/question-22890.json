Many of the \"rock and roll\" DJ's working at major market stations in the 50's through the '90's effectively used this approach.  Management took the position that announcers who stood during their airshifts were more alert, spontaneous and creative.  However, these poor guys had to stand for a two, three or four hour shift.  Because a meeting is a relatively short period of time, I think it is an approach worth considering.\n\n\nWe do not have stand-up meetings, however, this is not a new concept.
