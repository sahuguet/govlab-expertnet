  "text": "\n\nIt's been great to learn and still be tutored by many of you through this avenue.  Has anyone created and implemented a Utility (Line) Trench Cut Fee?  If so, what steps you took to create it and how has the implementation been?  I've been tasked to create one for our municipality and wonder if I could get some input from you.\nThank you. \nPeni\n\n",
