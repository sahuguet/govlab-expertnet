      "text": "\n\nA quick search on Google yielded quite a few results. I\u2019ve posted some links below about recruiting, hiring, and retaining Millennials. Most of the results below relate to the Federal government, but there is some overlap with local. Here are some thoughts based on personal experience & research: \nRecruiting- \n1)  Host a Local Government Management Fellow (or two, or three)! You can provide a nationally-recognized, competitive opportunity, and are getting top talent in return.  \n2)  Outreach to colleges/universities. There are a range of opportunities available in local government (e.g. in finance, engineering, planning, etc.), but that\u2019s not always clear to an observer. Work with Career Services to reach out to students and promote these opportunities. Students are looking for internships (esp. paid ones) to get a leg up, and local governments can provide great ones doing valuable work. In my department, we have a couple engineering interns that help with lighting and engineering analyses, which provides them with great experience they can put on a resume and shows them that they make a valuable contribution. \n3)  Demonstrate the difference. Show them how they can make a meaningful contribution to the community. Like most people, Millennials want to feel like they are making a difference. Maybe you could post a series of staff interviews wherein they describe what they\u2019ve done to make a difference in their community (e.g. secured a grant for a CNG station, recruited 2 local businesses, etc.). Emphasize this potential difference-making throughout the entire recruitment process. \n4)  Have an aesthetically-pleasing, easily navigable website. If your website is too complex or looks dated, that can reflect poorly on your organization. Ditto what Ron said about social media. \nHiring & Retaining- \n1)  Hire them. It sounds obvious, but one study found that 60% of surveyed hiring managers would hire a more mature worker over a Millennial:  http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/100912-mature-workers-263193.html?page=1 \n2)  Be respectful, especially to those you don\u2019t hire. Provide status updates to job applications so that they know they are even being considered. Show them that they didn\u2019t submit their resume or cover letter into a black hole, and you\u2019ll leave a better impression than other potential employers. That might translate into positive word-of-mouth or future applications for other positions. \n3)  Provide them opportunities to grow. Millennials are just starting out in their career, and are looking for experiences and knowledge that gives them a competitive edge, challenges them, and prepares them for future successes. Show them the multiple options & paths available in local government, and how that translates in private sector-speak (some people are not as familiar with opportunities in local government as they are with those in the private sector). Give them a solid mentor to guide them & to provide a strong professional relationship. \n4)  Be willing to innovate and listen to them. Have flexible work options, so that they can maintain a work-life balance (they may be involved in other activities beyond the office, like improv groups or volunteering). Consider technologically-progressive and fun office environments, like BYOD policies and social events. Don\u2019t ignore their ideas, but recognize that they bring a different perspective and encourage them to make the case for whatever ideas they bring. \nIn sum, lots of sites argue that Millennials want the same things as other workers (e.g. to be challenged, to make a meaningful contribution, to have a work-life balance), but may have different priorities. Again, here are some sites people may find useful: \nhttp://www.avuetech.com/blog/2012/04/23/why-does-the-federal-government-have-a-hard-time-recruiting-and-retaining-millennials/ \nhttp://www.avuetech.com/blog/2012/05/09/why-millennials-wont-work-for-the-government/ \nhttp://www.clearancejobs.com/cleared-news/644/15-recruiting-tips-for-hiring-millennials-in-government-and-the-defense-industry \nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/public-workforce/millennials-increase-government-popularity.html\n\n\nA quick search on Google yielded quite a few results.

(Paid or unpaid) I do suggest that you are honest about the potential for work afterwards. I would be more willing to work with you if you tell me in the beginning if I may or may not be hired after. I will not necessarily dismiss you if you say there will not be work afterwards.\n3) Put yourself out there.

I held a supervisory position with my own generation and often the major complaint was that our GM did not care. His leadership style was more classical and what is needed today is human resources management/leadership.  People may stick around with classical style management but work production declines significantly.\n2) When searching for organizations I look at my chances for advancement. If not within the organization, I want to it to provide experiences for growth.\n3) Take my ideas seriously and allow me to help you come up with a solution to our problem.
