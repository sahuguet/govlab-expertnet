Prior to doing so we conducted a service delivery evaluation to compare in-house cost to outsourcing.  That study can be located here:\nhttp://www.sanjoseca.gov/budget/FY1112/05MBA/MBA41-AlternateServiceDeliveryProposals-ParksLandscapeandCustodialServices.pdf\nIn addition, we also prepared a very detailed RFP to identify a vendor, which I can provide via email.    \nI should also note, the cities of Roseville and Brentwood CA have also outsourced park maintenance for a longer period of time and staffs from those organizations were very helpful in the research stage of our evaluation.   \nFeel free to pass on my contact information.\nJulie\n\n\nHi Pam,\n\nPrompted by significant budget challenges, and with the goal of preserving the highest level of park maintenance service for residents at the lowest possible cost, the City of San Jose outsourced routine maintenance at small parks and civic grounds last year.
