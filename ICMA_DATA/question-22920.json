The fee shall then be listed in the Schedule of Fees maintained in the City Clerk's office, but in handling the fee on a case-by-case basis, consideration can be given to the age of the road that will be disrupted.  It is worth noting that the City of Raymore may offer fee-free permits to projects with proposed right-of-way disruptions in planned improvement areas.\nAloha,\nJames Davidson\nKnowledge Network Intern\n\n\nHi Nadim,\n\nI went to the web for an answer to your question, and I found an example of a system that, while not tiered, would allow for the age of a street to be considered in the cost of the application fee. \n\nIn Section 515.170 of their \u201cManagement, Use and Occupancy of the Right-of-way\u201d code (http://www.raymore.com/DocumentCenter/Home/View/109), the City of Raymore, Missouri outlines a permit fee-setting schedule that lends the decision of the cost of a permit fee to the City Engineer.

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone currenly use a tiered fee structure for excavations made in the right of way? For example, if the street is only a year old maybe there is a higher fee associated with excavations as opposed to an older street with maybe a lower fee? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nNadim Badran\nAdministrative Intern\nKenilworth, llinois\n\n",
