It appears that we have about 80 (and counting) various reports that are sent to the board, administration and a host of other audiences on some kind of frequent basis.  These reports have different formats and circulate times and it is kind of like putting your arms around a cloud.   \nThe first step in our process has been to inventory all of the reports, their frequency, audiences and obtain copies.  In performing that function we found 30 that go to our Board at different intervals with different looks.  So phase one of our project focuses on streamlining the delivery of what we are calling real time reports to the Board in particular.  What we are doing is creating a repository on our transparency site where the most recent reports will be housed and available real time going forward.  This information will be easily accessible for public consumption as well as the Board.  We are also launching a quarterly summary report that will be sent to the Board which will tap the highlights from the real time reports as well as other key highlights that relate to our recently adopted strategic goals.  \nWe are so new at this that we are just in the process of building the page for our web site but anticipate sending the 1st quarter summary and sharing the page within a week or so with 5 of 30 reports availalbe online.  We will then be working to add additional reports to the repository and building templates to standardize the look of the reports.  \nWe would be very interested in what you decide to do as well.  We see this as linked to our dashboard initiative which is working on a parallel track.  If you like, let's connect and we can discuss further.    \nBest Regards,  \nTracy Miller  \nStrategic Management Advisor  \nSarasota County, FL  \ntmiller@scgov.net\n\n\nHi Shannon,  \n\nHappy New Year!
