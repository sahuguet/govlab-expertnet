  "text": "\n\nICMA's Center for Performance Measurement will be exploring ways to incorporate the powers of GIS into future Center offerings. Many (if not all) of the service areas CPM track has a spatial component. Furthermore, our Information Technology survey suggests that many jurisdictions already use GIS in multiple departments. Thus, we would like to ask the Knowledge Network:\nDoes your jurisdiction use GIS as a tool to aid performance? How so?\nDoes your jurisdiction use spatial data to evaluate performance after-the-fact? \nDoes your jurisdiction use GIS to gather data on a more real-time basis to address issues as they arise? \nAre there ways you would like to use GIS as a tool in performance management, but do not currently?\nPlease post your responses here and feel free to contact me at aszumski@icma.org to follow up on this topic!\n\n",
