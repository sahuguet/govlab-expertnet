  "text": "\n\nThe severance compensation in our community is defined (salary and housing allowance) in the City Charter and the length (three months) is fixed in the Charter as well.  Within a few months, the City Council must appoint a Charter Review Committee, so I am gathering information for possible amendments.  The current text was approved by voters in 1994, so I would like know if there is any data showing the average length of severance compensation for City Managers in recent years?  Thanks!\n\n",
