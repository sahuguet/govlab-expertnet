Salaried employees who are exempt from overtime provisions of FLSA are not charged for any sick leave time taken in less than a full day increment, except that when sick leave is taken on consecutive workdays, such employees are charged for all actual sick leave time taken.  Vacation leave accruals for salaried employees are charged actual leave time only for any non-sick related leave time taken in increments of four hours or greater.  Sick and vacation leave balances for salaried employees are reduced concurrently in conjunction with FMLA leave in accordance with the actual leave time taken.  See attached.\n\n\nCity of Clearwater, Florida currently maintains separate sick and vacation leave accruals for all employees.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Sierra Vista does something very similiar to Clearwater as explained by Alan above.  Except that we use the same 4 hour yardstick for sick as well as vacation.  Perhaps the difference is that leave may not be deducted when it is less than 4 hours, with the understanding that the employee is still expected to put 80 hours of work in a two week period.  So that means that if 3 different times in a week an employee leaves early for a doctor's appointment, it is expected that the City still gets its money's worth from them.\nOn the inclement weather issue (although extremely rare here!), the city-wide policy is if you are an essential employee, you must report to work.  If the City Manager decides that closure or a delayed start is in order, then no one is charged leave.  However, if an employee decides it is either unsafe for them to travel to work or they are unable to get here, they may stay home but they must take annual leave.  \nHope this helps.\n\n\nThe City of Sierra Vista does something very similiar to Clearwater as explained by Alan above.

  "text": "\n\nWe are interested in seeing how other localities handle annual/sick/inclement weather leave for exempt employees. If, for example, an exempt employee leaves an hour early for a dental appointment, does that employee have to use an hour of sick leave?  Or do you use leave in increments of half/whole days for exempt employees?\nThanks, \nLouise Wyatt\nAlbemarle County Human Resources\nlwyatt@albemarle.org\n\n",
