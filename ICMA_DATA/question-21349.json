The period (number of days) of illness is used to determine whether an employee must obtain a doctor's authorization and report to our Occupation Clinic before returning to work. Perhaps the \"minimum amount of time\" required may be tied to a flex-time policy in your case study if less than one hour. Our \"Medical Leave of Absence\" policy is accesible online at: http://www.pbcgov.com/publicaffairs/ppm/pdf/cw-p-053.pdf .\n\n\nInteresting question, but not an easy answer.

In garbage collection and  fleet maintenance, having employees call me at least an hour before their normal starting time, allows me as a manger to either reallocate existing staff or arrange for temporary/contract staff for the day.  I suspect a similar situation exists in streets and other \"team\" type physical labor jobs where having just one missing staff person can affect productivity for the entire day.\n\n\nIn my experience, a minimum call in time is common in jobs that must be done that same day, no matter the circumstances.

  "text": "\n\nIn my academic research, I have come across a policy that specifies a minimum amount of time required for employees to call in sick. I've seen the policy referenced in the context of fleet management and certain types of public works (water and streets).  Can anyone explain the rule's rationale and how it does/does not work? This is for a book I am writing on effective organizational rules. (I am looking to understand, not cite).\n\n",
