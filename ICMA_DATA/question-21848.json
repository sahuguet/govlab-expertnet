As we move forward with refreshes and make appropriate adjustments we are more and more satisfied with the plan. I would say this: it is probably erroneous to assume that all leadership and management understands strategic planning and is prepared for implementation.  Whatever process you select, be ready to spend some meaningful time on educating key players in the basics. Also, be sure whatever measure display tool you utilize is highly accessible. As implementation proceeds and staff sees performance within the plan parameters displayed publicly, a whole new level of engagement arises.\nNot sure if my contact info is visible, but if you have additional questions: Maria.ratliff@durhamnc.gov  919-560-4242 ext.19253\n\n\n(1) Do you do strategic planning with the city council?
