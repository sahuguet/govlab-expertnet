  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone still use the punch clock method for trade staff?   We are trying to get rid of this system which seems to represent low trust between managers and employees.  We now use two systems (manual punch clock and online time records) because some of the mangers do not trust their staff to enter their hours correctly.
