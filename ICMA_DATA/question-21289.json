If you compare that to say a helicopter at $700-$1200 per hour, that is pretty cheap. \nHowever I appreciate the comment and would love to start a dialog.\n\n\nJust fyi that includes all maintenance costs, fuel, insurance, hanger fees and salary for the pilot.

  "text": "\n\nIf you had a group approach your city and offer an airplane for public safety use with no capital costs, would you be interested?  \nWe have a low cost plane with pilot that with all costs included will fly over 1000 hours per year for about $200,000.00. Yet helicopter programs run into the millions of dollars per year.  \nI would be interested to talk with any city leaders about this concept or if you have any feedback or comments.\nThanks for your input in advance.\nHL\n\n",
