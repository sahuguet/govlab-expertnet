  "text": "\n\nI'm doing research on 311 and would like to know how your muncipality's call volumes changed in the first full year after implementing 311.  For example, did call volumes remain roughly the same as the last full year prior to implementing the program?  Did calls merely shift from multiple call centers to the 311 operation?  What about changes in the volumes of other types of contacts handled by 311 (e.g., e-mails)?  Thanks for your assistance.\nMatthew Eng\nCity of Seattle\n\n",
