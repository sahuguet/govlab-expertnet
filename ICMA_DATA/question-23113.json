Back in 2012, the Town exercised our franchise rights under the Town Charter to issue a charter to ourselves to provide residential trash service in the community.  We then bid out the service and contracted with a vendor to actually deliver the service to our citizens.  We handle the billing since we already bill for other utility services and we take customer service calls (missed collections, damaged cans, etc).  We have a five year contract with our vendor -and over that time, our citizens will save more than $1M in trash fees over previous providers and the Town will make nearly $750,000 in profit.  It's a win-win in our book.  \nOur public presentation is here - http://www.townofatoka.com/files/documents/Residential_Solid_Waste_Program_Presentation_10-16-2012_090959.pdf.\nHope that helps -\n\n\nJeff - we had the same issue for years in Atoka.

  "text": "\n\nI was wondering if anyone was doing anything creative in regards to the day trash is picked up within their jurisdiction? We have multiple providers for trash service in the metro area and all of them pick up on different days within the City. We have had some complaints recently from people in different neighborhoods that there is trash out for collection almost everyday. I realize the simple solution would be for the City to provide the service, but I was curious to see what our options are if any?\n\n",
