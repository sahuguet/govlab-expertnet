  "text": "\n\nThe City of Redondo Beach, CA is moving its Recreation and Community Services Department from a 12,000 square foot campus to a 6,000 sq. foot modular structure.  As well, the offices will be much farther from City Hall.  They are interested in what others do to stay connected; teleconferencing systems, GoToMeeting, WebEX, closed circuit, etc.  \nIf you are using technology tools to stay connected/communicate with off-site city offices, please let us know what resources you have implemented, including vendors,  please forward ASAP.  \nThank you!  \nPamela Muse  \nWestern Regional Director  \nAlliance for Innovation  \n888-468-6450  \npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
