In general, I think the personal statement should focus less on \u201cI did this and that, therefore I think I would be good in local government\u201d and more about how some personal event or experience has called you to public service/local government. Another angle could be how you think the efforts you put into a Fellowship will prepare you for the workplace after the Fellowship. The personal statement and case study both make up about 70% of the total score (see the FAQ at icma.org/lgmf for more details).\nJust my thoughts \u2013 I\u2019m not a reviewer, and of the twelve reviewers on the Advisory Board each has a different viewpoint so I can\u2019t say there\u2019s a silver bullet or \u201cone way\u201d to write an essay. Applicants are scored by three board members: an academic/former manager, a current manager, and a former Fellow. Scores are then blended/averaged.  All that said, one of the key requirements of being an effective manager is to communicate, convince, and inspire. If your essay can do that I think you should score fairly high.\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019d suggest is to look for the LGMF roster online and contact any current or former Fellows for their thoughts.

  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for any advice one might have with regards to the ICMA LGMF application process.  For instance, how did you go about crafting your personal statement?  What did you decide to focus on in your responses?  Also, what do you think separated you from equally qualified candidates?  I really appreciate any guidance you can give me.  Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. \nRegards,\nSeth\n\n",
