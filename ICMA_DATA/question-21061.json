As events vary in their impact on the park, the time between may vary, but certainly no sooner than 24 hours.   We have for instance cut our park shelter reservations to once per day, as multiple uses could not be serviced between rentals.   The same general approach is taken for special events.   Events are charged a nominal fee for the set up and break down days for large events, and these dates are secured on the calendar, thus helping to avoid doubling up events for the park.\n\n\nWilsonville, OR does not have a policy as such, but the park reservation department works closely with the public works department that maintains the parks and before reservations for special events are approved, they must be cleared by public works to ensure adequate time between events.

Our two most notable outdoor wedding facilities; the Shakespeare and Gold Medal wedding gardens are booked in two hour increments with a two hour public access period required in between each booking. At the same time, we only book one of the two gardens at a time.

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have a policy regarding a required length of time between holding special events within the same City park? For example, if a group holds a special event in your park this weekend, how soon can another large event take place in the same park? We are wondering if any general policies or even \"rules-of-thumb\" are routinely practiced out there and if those policies could be shared. Thank you.\n\n",
