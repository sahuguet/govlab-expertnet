  "text": "\n\nI'm currently the Fire Civil Service Comm. for the City of East Chicago, In. On our agenda is the question of the difference of hourly pay between Staff 8hr shifts and Line personnel 24hr shifts (3 platoon). For example a Asst. Chief earns $65,683.02 per yr but when calculating hourly rate 8hr shift=$31.58, and 24hr shift=$22.56 per hr. This seems very clear and easy to simply calculate salary divided by hrs per yr worked. The complication occurs because the city uses  Civil Service Law, and it states that all employees of equal rank earn the exact same salary. If an employee earns a higher income then that position must be tested for as it stands all staff personnel are assigned by the Fire Chief. Also according to recently passed City Ordinance there are only set number of different ranks the creation of a new rank would be unlawful. The dilemma occurs when overtime is earned and retirement payouts of comp time, sick time and unused vacation. Any advice or a direction to find similar cases would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
