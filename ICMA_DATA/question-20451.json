It's almost like determining the ROI for having a GPS in your car.  There might not be any measurable impact, but you'll never know how much time and gas you'd have wasted without it, and it's inherently important as a decisionmaker to have data regarding the operations you manage.  I think it's easier to justify PM's philosophically as fundamental for sound management, rather than to justify it on an ROI basis.\n\n\nI'd hate to be the one to try to pull that study off... the major returns for Performance Measurement is more informed decision-making, and I don't know how you can put a value to that or begin to guess what kinds of poor decisions might have been avoided as a result of having data-driven management.

The benefit of this particular ROI model, was the methodology for defining, capturing and measuring intangible \u201cvalue factors\u201d such as social, user, strategic alignment, etc. \nYou can find out more at this url: \nhttp://www.cio.gov/documents/ValueMeasuring_Methodology_HowToGuide_Oct_2002.pdf\n\n\nWhile this is not exactly what you requested, however I once use the Value Measuring Methodology (VMM) developed by the General Services Administration (GSA) Social Security Administration (SSA) to measure ROI for a service.
