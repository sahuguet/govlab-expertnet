Yonkers has an independent, self-sustaining parking authority with the ability to set its own rates, acquire and operate off street facilities, plus has some regulatory power over city for installing on street parking meters.  West Palm Beach has a Parking Administration which is part of the city government and has both on street parking meters and off street parking structures and lots.  Both have strengths and weaknesses and it really ultimately depends on what the local government wants to accomplish with public parking.\n\n\nI have experience in two cities with different structures, Yonkers, NY and West Palm Beach, FL.
