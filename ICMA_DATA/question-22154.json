  "text": "\n\nCrowdfunding has been successful in the private sector, particularly with Kickstarter as an example, but some have proposed crowdfunding to assist in public-sector projects (Neighbor.ly comes to mind). I'd like to gather opinions from local government administrators on this topic: Do you think crowdfunding for civic projects is a good idea, a bad idea, a mixed bag? Are you enthusiastic about the idea or perhaps cautious about possible consequences? \nMy article on the eCivis blog on the civic crowdfunding (http://blog.ecivis.com/bid/109038/Crowdfunding-in-the-Public-Sector) taps some expert opinion and overlaps somewhat with Evelina Moulder's ICMA article on e-democracy participation (icma.org/en/icma/newsroom/highlights/Article/101874/EDemocracy_Improves_Trust), but I'd like to extend the discussion to see what employees at the local government level have to say about this.\nWhat's your opinion?\nThanks in advance,\nTimothy Tiernan\nblog.ecivis.com\n\n",
