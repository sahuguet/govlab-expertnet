The City of Fort Lauderdale is looking for innovative ways that we can improve landscaping and beautification on our medians and major corridors, all while doing more with less. I have had a few meetigns with our landscape/maintenance team within our Parks and Recreation Department and have done some preliminary research on how other municipalities approach maintenance levels.

I would appreciate if you could share with me anything you come across as well.\n\n\nHi Charlotte, I am also interested in this topic.
