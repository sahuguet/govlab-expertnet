  "text": "\n\nOur City's Street Maintenance Division has two Crew Leaders that manage specific repair and maintenance projects.  We will be facing the retirement of one of these crew leaders and are looking at our promotion process (hasn't been an issue for over a decade).  I would like any information on a promotion process for this position including a written test.  In many communities this may be described as a foreman's position.\nYou may email me directly at rjfrank@hazelwoodmo.org, my telephone number is 314-513-5012.  Thank you for any assistance that can be provided.\nRobert Frank\n\n",
