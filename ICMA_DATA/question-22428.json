      "text": "\n\nHi Matthew,\nIn Raleigh, we just recently tried to break down the time commitments of our facilities maintenance staff, and we actually don't even do work orders for our preventive maintenance.  All of our work orders are reactive, and most of our maintenance staff are either 100% committed to preventive maintenance or work orders.  However, we do keep track of our preventive maintenance tasks in separate spreadsheets so that we know what needs to be completed.  Recently, we estimated that approximately 57% of our time is spent on PM and 43% is spent on unscheduled maintenance.  This is the first time we've really tried to track this, so we haven't set standards or benchmarks for it, but we did determine that we're going to need to try to squeeze a few more positions out of this year's budget in order to meet our needs in both maintenance areas.\n\n\nHi Matthew,\n\nIn Raleigh, we just recently tried to break down the time commitments of our facilities maintenance staff, and we actually don't even do work orders for our preventive maintenance.

In San Mateo, our current goal is to have at least 50% of our total work orders comprised of preventative maintenance work orders.  I'd like to know what other jurisdictions use as a goal to measure the extent of preventative maintenance work completed.  Thanks.  \nMatt Bronson\nInterim Streets and Facilities Manager\nCity of San Mateo, CA\n\n",
