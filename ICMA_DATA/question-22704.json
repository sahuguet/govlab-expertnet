In September 2012, we engaged an international professional environmental consulting firm, specializing in water resources management and  economics sciences to provide recommendations as how to achieve an equitable approach to capacity fee rates while also enabling future economic development.  The report was recently completed. We have not yet implemented any changes in our policy, but hope to integrate the recommendations into an Economic Development Incentive Policy for our community in the near future. I'd be glad to provide a copy of the report and discuss our approach with those who may be interested.\nThank you,\nDan\n\n\nHello Gregory,\n\nApologies for the late response.

The formula they are looking for would be calculated based on their economic value and their corporate income tax they pay to the city.  Has anyone done any work in this area?\nThanks,\nGreg Stopka, Central Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n847-271-7104\ngstopka@transformgov.org\n\n",
