I looked at Constant Contact at the time but Streamsend allowed me to upload an existing list and had better overall useability. Although staff shared a log in, we could create different lists with different users, so the Recreation Department e-mails came from the Rec Director, the Planning Department e-mails from the Planning secretary, and so on. Streamsend had a non-profit/government discount - I recall it was about $18 per month for 10,000 e-mails and we rarely exceeded it (and when we did it, it was still inexpensive).\n\n\nI have used Streamsend for years and am happy with it.

It hangs on high volume distributions, which means we have to chunk out our distribution into multiple e-mails. Constant Contact has the features I'm looking for, but it only allows one user (login) per account. What are others using for e-mail marketing and list management that allows for multiple users?\n\n",
