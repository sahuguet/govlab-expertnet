  "text": "\n\nWe are interested in creating an orientation manual for newly elected Council members.  I'm aware that most, if not all, of the municipal leagues produce such a document.  The manual that we'd like to produce will be more narrowly tailored and specific to our City - how do Council members get items on the agenda, what staff resources are available to Council, how do you reserve a City vehicle, what types of expenses will we reimburse, etc.  If anyone has such a manual for your City, I'd greatly appreciate it if you wouldn't mind sharing.  \nThanks for your help,\nJessica Roth\nAsst. to City Manager\nCity of Suwanee, GA\n\n",
