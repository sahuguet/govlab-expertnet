Your security is that it requires a majority of the Council to terminate you and in a sound Employment Agreement.  You should not work for a Council that will not approve a reasonable contract of terms and conditions and a reasonable severance provision.  I had 12 months because that is how long it typically takes a terminated manager in California to get a new position.  The same s true why city manager's want the department heads, the city manager must have full faith and confidence in a department head or be able to replace them at will.  The wrong city manager can hurt a city council and the wrong department head can hurt a city manager.\nI know of no CEO that is not working at will for all the same reasons.  true private sector golden parachutes are often significantly better then public sector, but the option is if that is one's need then work in the private sector.\n\n\nThe reason for at will employment for executives is that the City Council is the duly elected body by the people and must have the ability to have a city manger they have full faith and confidence.
