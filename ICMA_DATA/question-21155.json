  "text": "\n\nHello,\nI work for Durham County in North Carolina, and we have just begun the process of creating a strategic plan fo rthe county.  I have researched and found several examples of other counties that have gone through this process and their strategic plans, but I'm wondering if anyone can point me to those municipal or county governments that actually adopted the plans into the budget, thereby implementing it?\nThank you,\nEllen Whelan-Wuest\newwuest@durhamcountync.gov\nDurham County, NC\n\n",
