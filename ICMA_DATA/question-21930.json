      "text": "\n\nHere is a copy of an interlocal cooperation agreement which established an interlocal agency, the eCityGov Alliance.  My suggestion would be to establish an umbrella interlocal agreement under which a wide variety of sharing and/or services could be exchanged between the participating cities.  With the umbrella interlocal in place, it will be easier to create sub-agreements for specific shared services.\nEstablishing \"value\" in your situation could range from a set of guiding principles to binding performance agreements.  The interlocal could layout the principles and policy while individaul agreements could control and value specific work or work products.  \nAlso consider constructing the interlocal to allow other cities to easily join.  More sample documents can be found on our web site under the Documents tab, www.eCityGov.net.\n\n\nHere is a copy of an interlocal cooperation agreement which established an interlocal agency, the eCityGov Alliance.

In this case, my community is creating an organizational development plan for our neighbor; while the neighboring city is creating my city's performance measurement plan.  \nIn this instance, we'd like an agreement/contract outlining the \"value\" that each community is trading each other.  Is there such an agreement that exists?  \nThanks in advance for your response.\n\n",
