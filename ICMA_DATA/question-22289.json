Not that I disagree with your question, but a healthy succession plan does not require a specific amount of management level job openings. However, a healthy SP does require significant levels of management level job training. So, I would propose a second question, \"Does your organization or jurisdiction have a significant amount of training or mentoring to prepare (or qualify) Millennials currently hired for future management positions?\"\n\n\nRick,\nThanks for posing the question.

  "text": "\n\nDo you have enough management-level job openings in your jurisdiction available to the Millennial Generation (ages 17 to 34) to ensure a healthy succession plan? \nI am asking this question because we are researching our December web workshop on succession planning and bridging the generational gap between Baby Boomers and Millennials in local government. We are finding that the number of actual positions for which Millennials can qualify -- due to requirements for years of experience -- is incredibly low. I am wondering if other jurisdictions are noticing the same trend.\n\n",
