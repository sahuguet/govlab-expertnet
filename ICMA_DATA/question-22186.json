In general people fear the unknown and the complex; they are much more adept at understanding that which is closer to them. If a resident of a community has an issue with a municipal policy, he or she has multiple, effective avenues to address it: appealing directly to city hall, directly calling the department, or even writing letters to the editor in the local paper. \nFew people write their Congressman, Senator, or President because it is unlikely to change the tide. But if an individual knows their mayor, councilmember, or city administrator they can take their complaints directly to the source. Their local government paves their roads, educates their kids, responds to their emergencies, and mows their parks. The federal government passes complex, nuanced, and esoteric laws which cannot even be understood by half of those voting on the bills. \nBy and large, people are more satisfied with their local government because it provides more daily, interactive services than does the national government.\n\n\nI think that answering the philosophical side answers the practical side.
