  "text": "\n\nIn an article about Google Apps (available on the Knowledge Network here: http://icma.org/en/Article/100316/Washington_Uses_Google_Apps_to_Power_New_Intranet), we were  told of the recent switch to using Google Apps by the Washington, DC local government in order to save money  and streamline their ability to share data between employees.  With this sort of ideal in mind, there seems to be another logical step in this progression: starting to use free and/or open source software in order to make record-keeping much easier, as well as to ensure the ease of sharing data between government employees.  Unlike proprietary software, open source and free software is designed to enable the free transfer of your files and data to other programs if you so desire, which means fewer \u201crequired\u201d software upgrades in order to be able to function.\nIf this is true, using an open source solution for your computing needs will allow you to transfer to a different open source solution if and when you are so inclined, free of charge.  This seems to indicate huge possibilities in ease of records retention, as being able to access 10 year-old data will be far easier in the open source model (backwards compatibility is always a focus).  Has any local government moved to free software like Google Apps, or open source software like Open Office (http://www.openoffice.org), for record-keeping purposes or just in general?\n\n",
