  "text": "\n\nHas anyone developed policies and procedures around publishing financial transparency reports online?\nBackground: Washtenaw County, MI will launch a transparency section of our website with some new financial reports this fall. The new reports are: checkbook, credit card expenditures and salaries. We are previewing the reports internally this summer and have received a few requests to exclude payments from the reports - primarily based on privacy.\nSome of the privacy requests run between legislated privacy (HIPAA) to implied privacy (I didn't expect that to be published).\nWe're looking for help in developing policies around what can and should be excluded from our financial reports. And any other broad policies and procedures on transparency.\nThanks!\n-andy\n\n",
