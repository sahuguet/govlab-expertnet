The committee that developed the plan was comprised of citizens appointed by the Council who worked with a consulting group and staff to build consensus through surveys and charettes.  The amphitheater itself was constructed through grant funds and general fund dollars and Town event staff schedules its use throughout the year.

      "text": "\n\nHi Toni,\nI'm originally from Raleigh, NC, and the city just completed its downtown amphitheater  in June of 2010.  The project was funded by $2.6 million in public money.  For a short time, the city considered allowing Bud Light to sponsor the project and receive naming rights, in exchange for a large portion of that funding.  However, NC State law forbids naming any public venue after an alcoholic beverage, so Bud Light remains an event sponsor but did not sponsor construction.\nActs are booked through an agreement with Live Nation, and the season runs from April to October.\n\n\nHi Toni,\n\nI'm originally from Raleigh, NC, and the city just completed its downtown amphitheater  in June of 2010.
