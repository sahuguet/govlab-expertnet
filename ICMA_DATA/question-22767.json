If a candidate (or candidates as you describe) believes private, self-serving lobbying of particular board members is appropriate in the hiring process, why not expect that individual to operate in the same manner while serving?  If this is going on, and you are considering applying for this position, what sort of behavior should you expect from those doing the hiring?  Can a new manager change this type of governing board culture?  Do department heads and staff do the same type of private, self-serving lobbying to undermine the manager or other administrators?  Do governing board members approve of and encourage this type of behavior?  Lots of red flags to at least be aware of.  BTW, does this community have an independent citizens' open government\\transparency group?  If not, it certainly could benefit from one.\n\n\nIt is not a question of \"etiquette\", it is a matter of transparency and public confidence in both the selection process and the individual who is finally selected.

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone think it is acceptable for candidates for a town/city/county (etc.) Manager/Administrator position to contact individual Commissioners/Councilmembers during the recruitment process as part of the due diligence process?  If so (if I may ask) how many of you have done this?\nI have always gone out of my way not to contact individual Council/Board members during recruitment; however, I am hearing that other candidates are doing just that, putting those of us who do not do this at a disadvantage, it would seem.  I am aware that if the recruitment is through a professional recruiter that this would be up to them; however, I am referring to when the communities are doing their own recruitments.\nThought/comments, please!\n\n",
