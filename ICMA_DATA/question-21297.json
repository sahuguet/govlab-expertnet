The call is subject matter based with a facilitator being an expert in the issue discussed. You will be required to do readings and participate on the call.\nPersonally, the best part of the program is being connected up with a mentor. My mentor is fantastic and he has helped me grow professionally. As a young professional looking to make local government a career I found this relationship and the interactions to be invaluable.  The other nice piece of the program is the networking you get to do with other ELPDers - you here about people\u2019s background and perspectives that are different from yours. It is interesting to see how some issues/problems are solved in certain areas of the country compared to others (and how some these solutions would not fly where you work or live).\nHope this helps.\n\n\nI have my last class next month.
