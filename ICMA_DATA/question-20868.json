The dimensions that are typically measured are quality, time and cost. Improvements from benchmarking are doing things better, faster, and cheaper. The following are links that lead you to a pair of consulting firms that specialize in benchmarking. Gartner, Inc. is an information technology research and advisory company http://bit.ly/2ywceI. The Kaizen Institute is a consulting, training, benchmarking and qualification company, http://bit.ly/ecJ9GA.

      "text": "\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement (CPM) collects, cleans, and analyzes performance information in 18 service areas from 170+ local governments.  One of the 18 service areas that are measured is Information Technology.  CPM uses this information not to determine which local government is \"best\" or \"worst\", but, rather, to identify factors that allow some local governments to be high performers.  When high performing jurisdictions are identified, CPM facilitates the sharing of best practice information with all of the other participating local governments so that they all have the potential to improve their performance.\nCPM uses this same continuous learning model in all of the services it measures--Police, Fire & EMS, Code, Parks, HR, IT, Fleet, Facilities, etc.  A full list of the measured services, as well as a complete description of CPM's services, can be found at http://www.icma.org/performance .\nIf you have any questions or need more information--including a list of local governments in AZ that are CPM participants--please feel free to contact me directly.\n\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement (CPM) collects, cleans, and analyzes performance information in 18 service areas from 170+ local governments.
