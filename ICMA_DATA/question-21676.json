  "text": "\n\nThe Village of Taos Ski Valley, located in northern New Mexico elev. 9400', is looking to increase its snow removal services throughout the Village area, yet due to its small size and tax base we are having difficulty finding options to finance this project.  \nWith snow removal being such an integral part of an alpine village, we want to increase this service in order to increase the quality of life that should be availible to our residents.  Currently, our snow removal services are adaquate for what is required, but with increaseing development and the need to promote continuity throughout our village we are looking to beging to take over snow removal service in many new open pedestrian walkways and plazas.  \nThis increase in snow removal responsibility, coupled with the decreasing snow storage areas from new development has put VTSV in a compromising position in regards to liability, legal and financial.  \nBecause we only maintain a full time yearly population of less than 100 residents, our property tax revenue is very small in comparison to other mountain ski towns.  With this in mind, we are searching for ideas to increase funding for this increased service.  \nIf any small towns or villages could help us understand what would be an appropriate revenue source for this project, possibly in the form of a tax assessment or district, an enterprise fund, lodgers tax, or anything that another municipality is currently using sucessfully, it would be greatly appreciated. \nJohn Anthony Miller III\nIntern -  Village of Tao Ski Valley, New Mexico \n575-776-8220\nVTSV@vtsv.org\njohnmiller66@gmail.com\n\n",
