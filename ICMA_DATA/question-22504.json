  "text": "\n\nFor those municipalities large and small that offer early retirement buyout programs have any of you offered your employees health insurance benefits as an incentive to take the early retirement?  If you have what changes are/have you made since the passage of the Affordable Care act to your incentive programs to comply?\nThe reason I am asking is that we are considering offering a new round of early retirement buyouts.  Our last package offered retires single employee coverage for a specific length of time at the cities expense or until they reached the age of Medicare eligibility.  This time around we are a small enough entity that it may no longer be cost effective for us to continue to offer health insurance to our employees but to offer them funds to purchase their own insurance through the exchanges.  I didn't know if any other City had already faced this situation and could provide me with samples of their revised programs or if I was entering into uncharted territory.\n\n",
