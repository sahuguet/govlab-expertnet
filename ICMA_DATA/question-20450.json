  "text": "\n\nAre you attending this year's ICMA Conference in San Jose?  Want to participate even more than you already do during the educational sessions?  Then facilitating a roundtable might be just what you're looking for.\nRoundtables are an informal discussion about a specific topic where participants exchange ideas and experiences with each other.  Facilitating an ICMA roundtable is rather simple.  The facilitator, who has some experience or expertise him/herself, keeps the discussion on-point  and flowing.  Facilitators just need to be comfortable remaining in the assigned location for the hour with the possibility that zero, one, a few, or many participants attend.\nAttached is a list roundtables that do not have a facilitator as of yet.  If you're interested in being a facilitator, email me and I can answer any questions.\nThank you for your interest.\n\n",
