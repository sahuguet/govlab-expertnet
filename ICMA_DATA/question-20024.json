Local governments raise funds for their projects,  encourage employees to support causes like the United Way, conduct blood drives, donate expertise to professional associations that support local governments, all on work time.  It's part of being a good citizen of the community.  That said, and to address the point raised in the initial question, the local government should have an official policy that outlines the type of activity and level of effort that will be provided. A policy sets the boundaries, promotes transparency, and provides a way to address abuse.  If your cause is not covered by the policy, is strictly a personal endeavor, takes excessive resources, or is an activity prohibited by law (such as using public resources to promote a ballot measure) then its clearly unethical to do it during work hours.  As noted, ICMA has some really good advice on fundraising that will help avoid common pitfalls.\n\n\nLet's be clear: the ICMA Code of Ethics does not prohibit fundraising or supporting charitable and non-profit causes during work hours.

Tenet 7 says that while on duty a member should, \"refrain from all political activities which undermine public confidence in professional administrators.\" While fundraising for a non-profit may not inherently seem like a politically motivated activity, it can be. You do not want to set up a system in which cases must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Rather, a system with hard and fast guidlines would be more appropriate. \nThis is also consistent with ethical guidelines for employees in federal and state governments. Federal empolyees are not allowed to spend any official worktime devoted to any polictical or personal administrative or fundraising activity. \nIt seems to follow that if an activity would be unethical for the manager of a jurisdiction, it would also be unethical for his or her staff to undertake as well. \nIt basically comes down to one main question: Is  it ethcial for staff to spend time paid for by local taxpayers advocating for beliefs and activities that may not align with the priorities and beliefs of the local consituency?\n\n\nAccording to the ICMA code of ethics, it would not be appropriate for an ICMA member to spend ANY time involved with non-profit fundraising while on the clock.

However, the question about how much time is acceptable for an employee to be involved with any non-profit\u2019s fundraising activities or community service activities while on duty has arisen.  I\u2019d like to see how other Cities handle similar situations.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n",
