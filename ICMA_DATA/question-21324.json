But the willingness to step away from the old management systems that were pyramidal to a flatter organization that delegates to trusted and talented department heads who will share responsibility for success and failure will be the new normal.  Delegation is not new either but it hasn\u2019t been the standard.  The new social media rolling out across the U.S. and internationally will change how governments do business in a good way.  But with all good things, there are negative consequences.   These will include leaner organizations with more reliance on connectivity for day-to-day transactions.  From Council\u2019s using laptops for meetings to mobile I-pads in work vehicles, to on-line permit issuance and payments, to web-hosting of committee meetings from multiple locations.  This is all doable today but many government organizations are not set up nor committed to take the risk to work in this fashion.  In many cases, governments are not wired for this nor do many management teams have the understanding or the wherewithal to bring this to fruition.  Communication from the City Manager\u2019s office who can champion this change, set the vision, and explain and train their councils to agree to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements to establish leaner organizations, must be the beginning for reviving what taxpayers perceive as inefficient operations.  Managers must develop dashboard displays that give them the information to assess how each department is performing against performance benchmarks set for them.  This means department staff must begin to collect information differently and on an open architecture platform that allows for data transfer to occur seamlessly and efficiently.  Thomas Friedman, a New York Times columnist said, \u201cL is for leadership [and] in a social world, leaders need to inspire and empower everything coming up from below in a company or social movement and then edit and sculpt it with a vision\u201d for a targeted outcome. \nThe innovation teams that have been promoted by ICMA represent the foundation for getting the conversation started.  But government will need to maintain a relationship with the private sector who have already broken down many of these organizational roadblocks to efficiency because to them, it\u2019s a profit loser to allow inefficient systems.  To government, its breaking down a fiefdom who don\u2019t want to change from their comfort zone, its addressing conflict that may have a union component and management doesn\u2019t include representatives in the discussion, and so on.  But these conversations have to begin and everyone has to be in the conversation to build trust and to buy in to the potential that change can bring.  This will lead to the sustainable organization and it will be the new standard.\nBill Gilmore\nWilliam B.
