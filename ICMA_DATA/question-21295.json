      "text": "\n\nI am not knowledgeable of Florida law, in California if you register your city seal with the Secretary of State and pass a local ordinance you can prohibit it's use by anyone except the city for official government use.  This legally stops promoters from using the seal on promotions to make it look like its official business from the city.  You can still allow events to use the seal via the city becoming an official co-sponsor of the event, like a non-profit fundraiser or a Chamber of Commerce promotion.\nIf you have a separate logo or want to also use the seal for promotional activity, then your only real protection is to have it Trademarked.  The City of Beverly Hills has its well known shield Trademarked.  The city used to use  a separate design for it's city seal, but now is using just the Shield for maximum promotional reasons.  The city is compensated whenever anyone uses the Shield for commercial purposes be it in a movie or on a tee shirt.   You do have to enforce the Trademark to keep it protected.\nI would suggest you have the agency contact the City of Beverly Hills city managers office for more detailed information.\n\n\nI am not knowledgeable of Florida law, in California if you register your city seal with the Secretary of State and pass a local ordinance you can prohibit it's use by anyone except the city for official government use.

We also have guidelines for the appropriate graphic design use by staff. I don't believe we have an ordinance covering this subject, although the City Council has approved the use of outside counsel when needed to protect intellectual property rights (including trademark protection). I have attached both documents. Hope this information is helpful. Please contact me directly if more information is needed.\n\n\nScottsdale, Arizona has an administrative regulation covering the appropriate use of both the city symbol (logo) and city seal.
