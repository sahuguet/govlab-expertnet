We found that the vehicles are now more than ever able to handle an extended service life with no significant catastrophic failures.  Our study culminated a 2 and 1/2 year study in which every aspect of fleet management was verified, and indicated the move would save money.  We are based on a 105,000 mile replacement, with the average vehicle age at 7 years.  We have been utilizing this extension for 2 years and have yet to see any significant negative side effects.\n\n\nThe State of Utah extended their replacement criteria and will save $1.82 Million annually.
