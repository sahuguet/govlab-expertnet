It's only after you've determined what kind of service you want to provide that you can begin to make some of these other decisions.\nAnd finally, regional 311 systems are exceedingly rare.  There are a number of city-county systems in the U.S. and a few county systems that answer many questions about the services of the municipalities within their boundaries, but I'm not aware of a system whereby several municipalities share costs to provide 311 service to their citizens.\n\n\nI'm not aware of any open source CRM application available at this time.

Beyond the actual phone number, however, I think any local government can adopt the practices of a centralized customer service system (aka, a 311 service) if its desire to do so is strong enough.  It's a matter of documenting local government business practices and integrating those processes with the technology that gives call agents the access to the knowledge needed to respond to citizen calls for information and requests for service.\n\n\nI'm not familiar with the systems in Costa Rica to know if the phone companies there  can designate a particular number for a centralized call  center -- for example, Canadian cities use 311 and English cities have 101 for this purpose.
