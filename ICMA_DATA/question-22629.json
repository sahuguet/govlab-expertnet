I suppose the potential benefits, depending upon how it was delivered, could include reaching a wider audience and allowing their participation to occur on demand.\nHowever, my initial reaction would be to recommend that you consider a traditional, in-person academy.  A key part of the experience, from my perspective, is the development of the relationships between the participants and the employees/representatives of the jurisdiction.  In addition to \"teaching\" the participants about the local government, I would argue that building trust is one of the major goals of any citizens academy.  There is something to be said for looking someone in the eye, shaking their hand, and sticking around to talk with them after class.  Additionally, a virtual academy would severely dampen the ability of the class to make connections within the group - another benefit of bringing a group of civic-minded folks together under one roof.  Finally, any tours you might like to offer would not have the same impact on a computer screen as they would in person.\nI applaud your efforts to launch an academy in your jurisdiction.  They can be extremely rewarding to the participants and the staff as well.   My recommendation is to consider what you would like the participants to think/feel once the course is over, and ask yourself if you think a virtual academy can provide that.  If you are only trying to convey information to them (one way communication), perhaps it would work.  However, I think an in-person academy would provide a much more fulfilling experience with a lasting impact.  Believe it or not, we actually had a member of our class shedding tears at the graduation ceremony!\nSincerely,\nTom\n\n\nInteresting idea.

  "text": "\n\nOur city is looking into starting a Citizen Academy. We are considering having a nine week course that will give city departments the chance to teach and show what they do. I know there are some great examples already available on citizen academies. However, I am wondering if any city that has a citizen academy has thought about creating an online or virtual citizen academy.  What are your thoughts on an online/ virtual citizen academy? Does anyone have an example of one? \nThanks,\n\n",
