A lease may also work, but it is easier to break a licensing agreement. It is hard to bind a town on long term agreements, but usually renewable agreements work if you attach penalties to termination. As long as this contractor does not run afoul of civil rights, wages, etc. I doubt they will interfere, but you can always lock them in by asking first and getting any standards in writing.\nI would urge you to make sure the facility eventually becomes the property of the Town after it has depreciated out. Public entities can't take advantage of renewable energy credits so letting this contractor take advantage of those credits could be the difference between feasibility and a losing venture. Good luck!\n\n\nGary: There may be a way to make this work. Keep ownership of the underlying ground, and give them a license to build and manage the facility on behalf of the town.

The town receives federal funding so I am not even sure it would be legal for us to have a private facility on public park land...but we need to explore this nonetheless.\nCan anyone offer insight/experience and/or direct me to resources which will guide us through this process?\ngpalmer@townoffarragut.org\n\n",
