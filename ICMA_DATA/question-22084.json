      "text": "\n\nI think it's important to understand \"why\" residents are starting this new trend in the neighborhood before citing residents.  The reasons could stem from crime, lack of parking, street cleaning hours, etc. which are all legitimate reasons for parking your car in the backyard instead of alongside the curb. If the reason(s) for parking cars in the backyard cannot be solved or solved within a timely manor by the local jurisdiction, the jurisdiction should consider implementing parking pad standards (zoning) as a way to preserve the beauty and cohesiveness of the community while still addressing the residents concerns. I found this neighborhood zoning regulation on the City of Aurora, CO website: \"Parking Surfaces and Driveways; Only 40 percent of the front yard can be a parking or driveway surface. The parking or driveway surface in a rear yard cannot exceed 750 square feet or 25 percent of the backyard- whichever is less. Parking of any type of vehicles, boats, trailers and campers on landscape and/or lawn portion of the yard is prohibited. Any new parking area must be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, brick or stone pavers. All surfaces shall be maintained free of vegetation, weeds, dirt, trash and debris. \nGrandfathered rock parking surfaces must have a border and be maintained to a depth not less than 2 \u00bd inches. Failure to maintain requires compliance with new standards.\" \nI am not endorsing Aurora's zoning regulation, but it's an example of preserving the neighborhood, while still addressing the needs of the residents.\n\n\nI think it's important to understand \"why\" residents are starting this new trend in the neighborhood before citing residents.

Many suburban Chicago communities actually prohibit on-street parking during certain overnight hours (1-6 AM for example).  Residents have no alternative but to park in the driveways alongside their houses.  Most residential garages are at the far back end of the properties as well, so cars parked well away from the curb do not create a problem.  No vehicles are allowed anywhere on grass or landscaped areas, of course.  This practice does not seem to pose a concern for public safety, code enforcement or property maintenance.  Interesting that your community seems to be concerned that on-site vehicle parking and residential ingress\\egress might impact property values.  I'd be more concerned with foreclosures and short sales in the neighborhood.   Maybe that's just me.\nI agree with Matt that this may well provide an opportunity for meaningful engagement before the citation books come out.  Respectfully this sounds like too much government intrusion into peoples' lives.\n\n\n\"But a design change like this could be said to fall within normal freedom.

  "text": "\n\nAn emerging trend is playing out in the community.  Some new homeowners are flipping the house entrance from the designated front of the house to the rear of the home.   This appears to cause degradation to the property as well as the adjacent properties, block scape and generally disrupts the neighborhood and municipal landscape.   Example:  An automobile that would be parked at the curb on the original designated front of the property, is now parked in the new backyard which is different than the rest of the community.   What experience, knowledge or references exist across the ICMA network to address this disruptive change to the designated footprint to a home/house/property?\n\n",
