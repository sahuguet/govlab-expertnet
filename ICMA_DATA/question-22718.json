The narrow space between the sidewalk and curb is narrow and many times 5 feet or less.  Planting shade trees with large canopy are detrimental to sidewalks and curbs in these narrow spaces.  It is not recommened to plant these type of trees in these narrow space and would need to research type of small understory trees for these locations.  Many cities are turning to not planting any tree in these space unless there a minmimum of 20 feet between sidewalks and curb which allows tree root systems to grow and many times use smaller understory trees.  Root systems go where it can fine water and air and tends to migrate to these areas beneath the sidewalks and curbs.  There is no easy solutions and recommend you speak to a local arborist in your community as to types of trees that can be planted to prevent this.  We have gone to no planitng of trees in the rights-of-ways/narrow parkways and or center of tree trunks within 15 feet of sidewalks or curbs.\n\n\nRight tree right place - street trees are a big issue to damage of sidewalks and planting trees in right of ways is a big issue.

      "text": "\n\nIn August 2010, The City of Oklahoma City began Project 180 \u2013 a comprehensive plan to renovate 180 acres of streetscape in the downtown area to improve the appearance and make the central core more pedestrian friendly.  To date, the City has constructed five packages, or phases, of streetscape in downtown.  In general, the design places a tree in either a 5\u2019 X 5\u2019 or 5\u2019 X 10\u2019 tree well every 22 feet.  A concrete underlayment covered with a sand bed and concrete unit pavers (11-7/8\u201d X 5-7/8\u201d X 2-3/8\u201d) provides a walking surface between and around the trees.  Eight different varieties of trees were chosen, and an irrigation and drain system was included.  The first two utilized CU Structural Soil under the paving to allow the trees to have space for root growth. The next two featured the Silva cell System for the same purpose.  The last package used only rich mix soil in a compacted state.  Since these streetscapes have been constructed over the last three years, we are continuing to analyze the results from each process.  You can find additional information on our project website (http://okc180.com/) or the project architect\u2019s website (http://www.ojb.com/project/40-Project-180-Streetscape-1/).  A couple of photos have also been attached.\nIf you would like additional information and/or detailed specifications, please contact:\nShannon Cox, Project 180 Coordinator\n(405) 297-2130\nshannon.cox@okc.gov\n\n\nIn August 2010, The City of Oklahoma City began Project 180 \u2013 a comprehensive plan to renovate 180 acres of streetscape in the downtown area to improve the appearance and make the central core more pedestrian friendly.

  "text": "\n\nOur city continues to struggle with street trees damaging sidewalks in the downtown.  Does anyone have a set of standards to share that includes tree planting techniques (to prevent roots from dmaging sidewalks) or that require smaller pavers (1 or 2 foot squares) rather than typical sidewalk panels?  We are considering altering our regulations and would like to have alternatives to review.  Thanks.\n\n",
