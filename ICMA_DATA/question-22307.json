For instance, \"bump outs\" with trees or shrubs can be attractive for retail areas but they can also cut down available on street parking slots and can also be pedestrian unfriendly in accessing stores.  Planting fast growing trees is another popular measure which during daylight hours is attractive but as trees reach heights that restrict artificial lighting in the night hours can create concerns about shopper safety.  The critical need to accomplish desired outcomes for beautification measures is to look at the big picture generally which entails not only beautification related planners but also public safety, economic development, parking, local merchants associations. etc. to be sure that all potential consequences are weighed.  As a more general guideline, a fundamental principle in economic development is that more demonstrated local government commitment (both capital and operating) to infrastructure including appearance of commercial areas, the higher degree of likely success in inducing sustained growth in private sector investment.\n\n\nCan't help on pointing you to studies but can briefly share personal experience.

On page 37, it talks about having higher standards for businesses in terms of beautification, in order to lower the costs for the city itself. The rest of the document goes into greater depth about the benefits for attracting businesses of having a beautified downtown area, as well as the standards set forth for those businesses applying their own beautification.\nhttps://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/302142\nIn this Sustainability Plan for the city of Bridgeport, CT, page 13 features an explanation of how beautification of blighted areas can increase nearby property values.\nhttps://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/301390\nThis description of Cincinnati\u2019s Neighborhood improvement plan also discusses the use of beautification to decrease blight and thus foster economic growth. \nhttps://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/100174\nI hope this was helpful in what you\u2019re looking for.

  "text": "\n\nI am preparing to give a presentation to my council about beautification.  We have several on the council that believe beautification is bricks and mortar.  I am looking for some articles or studies that talk about beautification increasing economic development.  Our community is fairly utilitarian and we need more beautification to attract more people and businesses to our community.  Any ideas?\n\n",
