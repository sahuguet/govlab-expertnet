  "text": "\n\nHello all. I am graduating this year with my MPA. I have been doing some networking, going to the City Council meetings, emailed quite a few Mayors and City Managers with no luck. My ultimate goal is to land a position at a City Manager's Office.\nNonetheless at this point, getting a job in the Public Sector that will allow me to learn as much as possible is priority. Do you have any suggestions? links? anything that will put me on the right path.\nThank you so much, and I read some of you guys' profile, big congratulations to all that started with at least an internship so far... we are the future public servants.\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
