      "text": "\n\nHi Mark:\nIn addition to what Max mentioned, I have a few more considerations for you to keep in mind when making this decision:\n1) Liebert process coolers are extremely high-quality, and are known for almost never going down (and even if they do have problems, it will usually be for a day or less, more often only a few hours).  As such, you could probably consider a cheaper option than something 1/3 the cost of a Liebert; it is likely that a commercial unit would suffice, if the room is not too large.\n2a) Regardless of whether you purchase a split unit or some other unit for the backup, be certain that it will be able to keep your server room at a constant 45-55% relative humidity level (this is necessary, as lower will lead to an increased risk of static electrical discharges, and higher will be detrimental to the server electronics).  Purchasing an AC unit at an incredible price will be a problem if it cannot keep the humidity constant.\n2b) If you do decide to go with that commercial split AC, keep in mind that those are known to remove humidity from that air as opposed to keeping it balanced.  This could potentially lead to a problem, but there is a fairly easy fix for this: install the backup system, but then make sure that your server room is attached to the air supply of the rest of your office (or put in vents that can be opened if/when the Liebert is broken).  That way, the humidity in the regular office environment (from people breathing, etc) will be able to be introduced into the server room environment, which the backup unit will balance out to optimum levels.\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Mark:\nIn addition to what Max mentioned, I have a few more considerations for you to keep in mind when making this decision:\n\n1) Liebert process coolers are extremely high-quality, and are known for almost never going down (and even if they do have problems, it will usually be for a day or less, more often only a few hours).
