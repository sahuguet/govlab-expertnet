  "text": "\n\nI'm working as an energy strategy consultant with a city this summer, and one of the projects I'm trying to implement is the adoption of a preventive maintenance program.\nAlthough the leadership recognizes that preventive maintenance can be beneficial, it is challenging to try and quantify exactly how beneficial it is. In other words, it is difficult to arrive at an amount of money to invest in such a program while still guaranteeing benefits in terms of $ saved in electricity bills, equipment replacement, maintenance hours etc. \nIf anyone has worked on or has heard of organizations that have successfully quantified the economical/environmental benefits of preventive maintenance, I would love to hear about it. \nThanks,\nAni Krishnan\n\n",
