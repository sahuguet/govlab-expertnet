  "text": "\n\nThe City of Walla Walla is interested in converting its budgets for Capital Improvement Projects and grants to continuing appropriations so that it may carry over the project budget balances from year to year without having to request Council approval each year.  Instead the Council would approve the full project or grant budget for multiple years. Thus far we have not been successful in identifying another municipality in the State of Washington that uses continuing appropriations. We are particularly interested in acquiring examples of the ordinances and other documents necessary for authorizing continuing appropriations. We would greatly appreciate any suggestions and implementation documents that you may have to assist us. Thanks.\n\n",
