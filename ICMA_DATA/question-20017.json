Having a closer proximity to constituents, aka not being isolated with bureaucracy, can sure keep you on your toes! Having a broad based education and real-world experience is almost a necessity.

I am in a community of under 5000 and have found that due to budget issues (and yes it is always about the budget) we are lacking many department head positions of which I fill the void; human resources, labor relations, community and economic development, planning and zoning, recreation are just a few I handle exclusively.  I often think that managing a large city would offer a reprieve as you would have a greater number of staff in which to delegate too affording you the opportunity to really be a city manager/administrator.  It is interesting to see just how big the little things end up and how unusual they are-priorities in small towns are interesting, sometimes I think they don\u2019t want to see the big picture.\n\n\nI agree that we have to be generalists and also be willing and able to wear many hats and have expertise in many areas as you tend to fill those department head positions.
