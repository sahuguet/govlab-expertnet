  "text": "\n\nOur Budget Division would like to organize our shared drive. Currently some file and folder locations make sense while others don't. I would like to know if anyone has reorganized their shared drive recently (especially if your a budget office), and what strategy did you use to do so. Was there a website that was helpful? What does your file structure look like now? If you have a pdf or other visual of the new structure to look at, that would be helpful too.\nThanks in advance for any responses.\nAlan\n\n",
