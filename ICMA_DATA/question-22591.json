  "text": "\n\nThe greatest sports players in history even struck out or missed a few shots in their careers; sometimes during the biggest games.  But we remember, most times, those players for their magnitude of contributions to the sport despite those huge mistakes.  That's where you come in...\nThis year\u2019s ICMA Conference in Boston will host an educational session entitled \u201cForging Onwards After Failure\u201d where a panel of members, in rapid-fire format, describes some of the biggest mistakes they've made during their local government management careers and how they rebounded and learned from those mistakes.  We were hoping to attract 8 to 10 members willing to share but at this point only one  has graciously volunteered. \nThe session is on Tuesday, September 24, from 3:30p - 4:40p.  Here's the preliminary program description:\n\"Spanish philosopher Georges Santayana warned that \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" If you believe this to be true, attend this session where senior professionals describe their biggest flops, what they learned from their failures, and how they dusted themselves off and forged ahead all the wiser.\"\nPlease contact me directly if you'd like to serve on the panel.  You can email me at jdailey@icma.org or call (202) 962-3557 / (570) 807-8528.  \nThank you in advance for helping your fellow ICMA members from repeating the (bad parts of the) past.\n\n",
