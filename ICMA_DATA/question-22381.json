What you are really trying to determine is if they actually both cost $400,000 and they probably don't. \nAssuming you are currently incurring costs for injuries and you can reduce the appropriation for that cost in future years by replacing the flooring, then the future savings may offset some or all of the cost of renovations. There just may be a timing issue because of the delay in when you receive the savings. On the other hand, the investment in positions for the Sheriff may have offsets if there are potential claims that can be made against the jurisdiction for understaffing. If you have claims experience there, they need to be factored in as well.  \nFinally, one is a non-recurring cost and the other is recurring. Run both options through a multi-year analysis and the cost comparison is far from similar.\nThe GFOA book is cheap and has a variety of tools you may find useful for this and other analyses.\n\n\nPaul:\n\nFor another resource, consider GFOA's publication \"Decision Tools for Budgetary Analysis.\" It describes a couple tools that may be relevant -- building an expected values table and using weighted score tables. \n\nOn the surface, you have a barter economy -- is the value of services received in one program area more valuable than that in another because they both cost the same?

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone know of examples of adding the element of risk into budget decision making? I know we all have it in our minds when considering proposals for funding. However, I'm wondering if anyone out there has developed a simple (or simple as possible) method for using risk to determine whether to fund one proposal over another.\nLet's say (for example... this is completely hypothetical)...\nProposal 1:\nThe Sheriff has requested $400,000 in new positions due to larger jail populations\nProposal 2:\nThe Building Services Department wants $400,000 to remodel the lobby because the floring keeps coming up and creating tripping hazards to public and staff\nLeaving out all of the other issues we usually look at. If potential risk of not funding was included as a variable in the decision making process, is there an easy way to determine what that is?\nAny examples or information would be great.\nThanks,\nAlan\n\n",
