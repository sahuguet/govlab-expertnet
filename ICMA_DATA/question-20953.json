I\u2019ve noted that organizations first venturing into performance measurement often do so because elected officials and others want quantitative support for budget decision-making. While that is a perfectly rational basis for developing a performance measurement system, the real strength of these systems is in supporting organizational learning and strategic planning, of which resource allocation (budgeting) is but a component, though an important one. Fundamentally, performance measurement systems need employee buy-in and exercise to remain healthy, properly functioning feedback (learning) loops. \nBy \u201cexercise\u201d, I mean they must be used by staff at all levels in the organization on a routine basis \u2013 not on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, but daily, as appropriate. All staff must know how their performance is assessed, have easy-access to indicators that help to self-assess progress in advancing personal, departmental, or organizational goals and objectives, and know how his/her activities influence important outcomes. Not everyone needs to be a statistics geek, but rather have access to meaningful feedback for his/her level of responsibility. For example, a building permit counter clerk may have access to day before customer service survey results from counter activity, among other insights. \nAll too often, those aspiring to link performance measures to budget deliberations and strategic planning get out ahead of themselves by failing to get department heads \u2013 and their staff at all levels \u2013 collecting and using, i.e., learning from, performance data on a routine basis. Unless and until front line staff are using and learning from performance data, linking it to budgeting and strategic planning is virtually and exercise in futility. This isn\u2019t a front line staff failure, but rather one of leadership and supervision, both essential elements of a robust performance measurement system. \nI believe this sort of message needs emphasis every time one responds to an inquiry like, \u201cI am looking for municipalities currently using performance measures as part of their budget.\u201d Didn\u2019t many of us start with a similar \u201cmission\u201d from our City Manager and/or Board/Council? Without additional information, one can never tell what groundwork has already been laid in advance of endeavoring to develop and link metrics to budget discussions. Thus, the first response to such inquiries might best be something like, \u201cIt\u2019s great to read that you\u2019re interested in linking performance measurement to budgeting, can you tell me a little about the current state of your organization\u2019s measurement system and how you\u2019re using the data you\u2019re collecting?\u201d Advice can then stem from the response.\n\n\nComing late to the conversation, I can't add much to what Tom and Barry have already communicated. That written, one additional highlight is worth commenting on. I\u2019ve noted that organizations first venturing into performance measurement often do so because elected officials and others want quantitative support for budget decision-making. While that is a perfectly rational basis for developing a performance measurement system, the real strength of these systems is in supporting organizational learning and strategic planning, of which resource allocation (budgeting) is but a component, though an important one. Fundamentally, performance measurement systems need employee buy-in and exercise to remain healthy, properly functioning feedback (learning) loops. \n\nBy \u201cexercise\u201d, I mean they must be used by staff at all levels in the organization on a routine basis \u2013 not on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, but daily, as appropriate. All staff must know how their performance is assessed, have easy-access to indicators that help to self-assess progress in advancing personal, departmental, or organizational goals and objectives, and know how his/her activities influence important outcomes.

The key thing is how do we tell our story in a manner that our citizens understand it, and actually believe we are not using statistics or figures to paint the picture we actually want personally. That is what I consider the 'holy grail' of performance measurement or management.\nFor example, when I was the elected County Auditor in a small county in Washington State for nine years, I had numerous surveys from my customers (citizens for elections, document recording, vehicle licensing, finance) who complained about my having too many staff that were unresponsive to the customer needs. At first I disregarded these surveys as being a small minority, but then I took a closer look at my staff and saw there were staff that needed improvements some large some small. Well, I heard from the community that the cost of government was too high, I reduced my 11 staff to 9.5 staff, paid my existing staff more money and increased their training exponentially. This resulted in more cost effective service and my customer service surveys showed an increase in customer satisfaction.\nHowever, the reduction in staff led to increase citizen outrage for those people who were not my everday customers, even though I had the performance metrics to back up my decision.\nThis is a case where I let my performance metrics drive my political decisions, and not the other way around. However, I can undrstand the rationale for doing it the other way around, and now that I answer to a 7 member elected board, I have an insight into the political world and political ramifications of decisions that they make. I think this with the use of performance metrics helps us have stronger decisions in the long run that we can get buy-in from interested stakeholders.\nTom, I see you are with Vancouver, I audited them in 2000 and 2001 when I was with the Washington state Auditor's office and Linda Gellings was the Finance Director there. I don't think we have met, but it was a fun audit to perform.\n\n\nWe would all agree that the reason we want some sort of performance measurement is to tell our story.
