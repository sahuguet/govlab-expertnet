      "text": "\n\nWe installed cell antenna's on towers in my previous city.  There are consultants who will work with you to get the best deal.  Work involves engineering analysis to ensure the tower and antennas are in good shape and installed appropriately.  A consultant may help you maximize potential revenues by designing so that you could get more than one antenna on your tower.  You may also be able to get some needed repairs included.  Lease fees vary based on many factors but I think the population of  the area/call volume is the major factor.  Our agreements ranged from $1000 a month to $2000 a month.  Most agreements are long term as the install is costly, 200k.  I think this is listed as personal property so you get taxes on this too.\n\n\nWe installed cell antenna's on towers in my previous city.
