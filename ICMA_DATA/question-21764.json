      "text": "\n\nEllie...While there is always the potential for conflict with developers who desire to create a project that doesn't always meet the City's ordinances and codes, we have tried to overcome the worst of that in several ways.  First, staff worked with the Council several years ago to streamline the process as much as possible for developers and builders.  Where a project used to take 2-4 months to get through the process, we can now get it done in 2 weeks to 2 months depending on the complexity of the project and the zoning needs of the applicant.  Secondy, we work to get the planning department involved with any development opportunity as soon as possible. We have had meetings with a number of developers and the planning dept that have never panned out, but when they do, the developer has all of our maps, policies, development guidelines and even a rough timetable from start to finish that they can use to track the progress of their project through the City.  We try to be upfront about potential pitfalls and give them a realistic view of what our Council, Board of Adjustment, and/or Planning Commission have approved in the past and might be willing to approve at this time.    Even with all of this, we still have problems from time to time.  It's unavoidable unfortunately.  What we have found ultimately, is that customer service starts with the City Manager setting the example and then holding managers accountable.  Hope this helps.\n\n\nEllie...While there is always the potential for conflict with developers who desire to create a project that doesn't always meet the City's ordinances and codes, we have tried to overcome the worst of that in several ways.

      "text": "\n\nEvery community is unique and I recognize that specific issues may differ; however, I have found that issues between the development community (contractors, architects and developers) and the development department can usually be addressed with a combination of four approaches.\nSELF-AWARENESS:   One of my favorite quotes is that \u201cwe tend to be blind to our assumptions when we are locked inside them,\u201d (author unknown).  Communities, and development departments in particular, have critical tasks to accomplish and can sometimes become locked inside their assumptions.  Having a check on those assumptions is important and can take many different forms.  \nWhen I served in Oconee County, we hosted an annual economic development event facilitated by UGA\u2019s Vinson Institute.  We usually had around 200 in attendance and discussed every facet of our economic development program as well as our development department.    The University used polling technology to gain feedback on the department and whether the audience agreed with our current direction.  More recently, the internet has provided cheaper ways to gain feedback with survey services.  Posting the address of a third party survey website at the front counter, on permits, and even directly in the signature lines of emails has become easily accomplished.  These survey results can be compiled and reviewed.  The idea of customer feedback can scare many employees, but the reality is that most people respond truthfully and provide meaningful insight.  \u201cComplaints are gifts,\u201d as Dr. Janelle Barlow stated, and \u201care statements about expectations that have not been met. They are also, and perhaps more importantly, opportunities for organizations to reconnect with customers by fixing service or product breakdowns.\u201d\nA second issue in the area of self awareness relates to assuring that development department employees are aware of the behaviors that build or destroy trust in a community.  The current economic situation has created a great deal of stress that exaggerates problems at all levels. We have provided training for our staff on the actions required to build and maintain trust.\nOPENNESS:  When rules are easily understood, much conflict can be avoided.  This openness can be achieved by publishing clearly understood guidelines, checklists and other materials for the front counter and the website.  Milton, Georgia has dedicated a page of their website to these checklists, forms, etc.  The direct link is: http://cityofmiltonga.us/index.asp?Type=B_LIST&SEC={87A3EF43-24AF-4B59-B9BF-DF9FFABDDB38}#{C81F2753-8BB0-4C30-A24E-12D600BB9EF5}.  By being open, the development community clearly understands the rules and process for taking a project from concept to ribbon cutting. \nOUTREACH:  I have often heard planners and inspectors say that they \u201ccannot design/build it for a contractor.\u201d  I agree with this statement and understand that many builders have tried to use the department for design or to create punch lists for projects.  However, the department can host or facilitate meetings with the development community as a whole that addresses concerns found on specific projects.   We have hosted meetings in several of our jurisdictions such as Johns Creek, GA for developers to discuss the top ten violations found during inspections and provide direction on how to avoid these violations in the future.  \nTEAMWORK:  As the regulating agency for the development community, there will naturally be conflict and a line of separation.  However, this should not prohibit working together on other projects that benefit the community.   The specific projects will be determined by what is important to the community, but I encourage choosing a community project on which both the department and the development community can participate.  Decatur, Georgia\u2019s MLK Jr. Service Project provides free home maintenance and repair for Decatur's needy senior homeowners each January.   This project has a tremendous impact on the lives of Decatur\u2019s senior citizens. The city coordinates the project and volunteers, including skilled professionals such as electricians and plumbers from contributing construction firms, perform a broad range of repairs including but not limited to:  handicap ramp construction, door repair, siding repair, fixing water leaks, correcting unsafe wiring, attic framing, roof leaks repair, sump pump installation, and energy efficiency work.  Non skilled trades people also volunteer for jobs like raking leaves, trimming bushes, and junk removal.  The program is a great way to work together and creates trust through teamwork and accomplishment.\nI hope these ideas are helpful.  You can reach out to the communities mentioned above or visit the websites for more information about specific programs.  I would also be happy to answer any other questions.\n\n\nEvery community is unique and I recognize that specific issues may differ; however, I have found that issues between the development community (contractors, architects and developers) and the development department can usually be addressed with a combination of four approaches.\n\nSELF-AWARENESS:   One of my favorite quotes is that \u201cwe tend to be blind to our assumptions when we are locked inside them,\u201d (author unknown).
