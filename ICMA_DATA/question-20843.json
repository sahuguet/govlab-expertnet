We\u2019re evaluating the types of calls we automatically dispatch officers to as we are experiencing a high number of calls that are not emergencies or do not require immediate police assistance.\n\nWe would like to know if your agency has dealt with this issue, if so how?\nAre there any calls for service that your officers no longer automatically respond to?\nDoes your agency have a differential response program to triage non-priority calls?\nDoes you agency utilize a questionnaire for 911 operators to screen calls and determine if a crime or emergency is in progress?\n\nAny assistance would be much appreciated,\nThank you!\n\n",
