It's underneath a municipal parking garage and above serveral retail spaces that the City also owns and leases out to businesses.  The cool thing about this space is that it serves as an extended meeting space for City Hall, a public meeting space that includes a kitchen, small conference room, larger meeting room and a gallery space (anyone can use the space via a reservation) and since it's opened, non profits who also occupy the space have managed it for us.  Here's the website - management just transfered over as of today to a new non profit - Piedmont Council for the Arts.  http://charlottesvillearts.org/cityspace/ \nGood luck with your research!\n\n\nTracy, the City of Charlottesville owns a space called City Space.
