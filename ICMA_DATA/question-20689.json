The other (often referred to as Six Sigma) identifies and reduces variation from the norm. This is a much more time (and financially) consuming process. Most often, if there is a problem with the process itself and you've never done this type of work before, LEAN Process Improvement would be your first step. I would suggest, as others have, having a core group of people in your organization trained. It will take the better part of a week (full-time) to appropriately train (more time is better if you have it). Then, once those \"Champions,\" have completed a few projects, they can continue and train others internally until you have a good core group of facilitators. That brings me to the next tip, you should also get these people trained in facilitation skills and not just process improvement. If the people doing a process improvement cannot facilitate the discussion in a meaningful way, it won't matter how good they are at process improvement.  That being said, I think I have some training material I can share, but without proper training, I don't know how much you're going to get out of the process.

The result was that each department has an employee with process mapping experience and know-how. The course was developed around a book by Dan Madison titled \"Process Mapping, Process Improvement, and Process Management: A Practical Guide to Enhancing Work and Information Flow.\" I think you would find the book very helpful!  \nContact me if you have any questions or want to see some of the maps we've put together.
