As we deal with homeowners, but we also deal with a lot of contractors that are set up to pay their accounts by credit cards, credit reporting would not work in this instance because the amounts of their bills change each week.  And the individual homeowners, is usually a one-time payment for a permit.  But, I am not sure that when someone bounces a check, their checks are referred to a collection agency.  If unpaid, this may go to the credit reporting agency, eventually.\n\n\nHello.\n\nI believe that our local jurisdiction does this for water utilities but in my area for building permits, I don't think it would work.

  "text": "\n\nHas your jurisdiction considered providing payment history information to reporting agencies, in an effort to help residents establish credit?\nWe realize that many of our residents have trouble acquiring loans (either private or from our government programs) because of lack of credit.  They may only have their utilities payment history (water bill, waste collection, electricity) to speak for them.   We're wondering if any other jurisdiction has ever considered reporting payment history to the private credit reporting agencies to help them build their credit score..\n\n",
