  "text": "\n\nRecently, several jurisdictions that participate in the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement (http://icma.org/performance) have created social media pages for their Parks and Recreation departments, which have helped them advertise events and send out maintenance updates in a timely, cost-efficient manner.  In a few cases, jurisdictions have received considerable praise for their use of social media to disseminate information, particularly if it is time-sensitive or involves emergency management.\nA few examples include:  Richland, WA (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Richland-Parks-and-Recreation/212541152097441)\n                                         Phoenix, AZ (http://www.facebook.com/phoenixparks)\n                                         Dallas, TX (http://www.facebook.com/DallasPARD)\nDoes your parks and recreation department use facebook or twitter to make announcements or post updates?  If so, how has the page been received by citizens?  Have you experienced increased participation in programs and events since creating the page?\n\n",
