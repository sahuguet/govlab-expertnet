This PSM will/should have experience in both disciplines, Police and Fire.\nI see a problem with eliminating Chiefs of these very different disciplines. While both are focused on public safety, each have very differing tactics, job requirements, employee base, customer base etc. etc. Having the staff of Fire and Police report to \u2018One Master\u2019 might pose problems down the road. I can go on and on with this topic.

      "text": "\n\nYou may wish to look at the experience of Edina, Minnesota (Warren Hyde (deceased), City Manager) during the late 1970s. The transition to a single Public Safety Director took place with the retirements of a long-time Police Chief and Fire Chief, I believe in 1975. The Assistant Fire Chief, a 15+ year employee who was a skilled administrator and top flight fire safety technician (adjunct professor at Tulane, in fire safety) was chosen to lead the two organizations.\nThe two departments had a long history of cooperation and cross-training of the police officers in fire supression. In addition, as a result of financial incentives, a majority of the two departments had at least an AA degree, or a BA. So, the officers and fire fighters were generally more intellectually open to change.\nI believe the experiment lasted into the 1980s. I had moved on by then and lost track.\nI agree with Ralph that there are difficulties with making it work, not the least of which in Edina was the disparate union contracts (police - Teamsters, fire fighters - IAFF). The key is the skill of the Chief in forging a cooperative effort and achieving credibility with the rank and file.\n\n\nYou may wish to look at the experience of Edina, Minnesota (Warren Hyde (deceased), City Manager) during the late 1970s.

      "text": "\n\nHaving been a public safety director and overseen the consolidation of a police and fire department into a fully cross-trained department, the key to a consolidation is recognition by political, community, and employees. Too often one group or the other will \"wait and hope\" things will revert or (overtly and covertly) encourage such a change; only when it is embraced and recognized as the method for delivering services will it be successful. One can look at several cities in Michigan: Ionia, Petoskey, Greenville, Berkley or Southlake, Texas. All are smaller communities with different populations and demands. All made the transition and continue to deliver higher quality services than prior to the consolidation. \nA public safety director will need a good \"number 2\" in police and fire for the director will be concentrating on administration, planning, and organizational functions. The number 2 person works with the groups and, if not fully consolidated, must deal with the differences. Police normally operate as individuals and are fairly independent; fire function and train as teams. I found the fire background persons ideal for public education (including D.A.R.E. and school liaisons) because it exploited those differences.\n\n\nHaving been a public safety director and overseen the consolidation of a police and fire department into a fully cross-trained department, the key to a consolidation is recognition by political, community, and employees.
