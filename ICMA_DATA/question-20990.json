However, ICMA\u2019s Center for Public Safety Management does offer consulting services on scheduling problems. Additionally, they would be a good resource to contact to see what types of software they have seen be most effective in other communities.  \nFor an article that describes how one county used their services to create an effective scheduling system, I suggest \u201cBalancing Public Safety and Budget Constraints: Loudoun County, Virginia\u201d: \nhttp://bit.ly/lzgVLo \nFor more information on ICMA\u2019s Center for Public Safety Management, please visit: \nhttp://icma.org/en/Page/902/ICMA_Center_for_Public_Safety_Management \nI hope this helps! \nAmanda Dodge \nInternational City/County Management Association \nKnowledge Network Intern \n202-962-3699 \nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Matthew, \n\nSince I am not a local government official I do not have any personal experience with using police scheduling software, although a quick Google search produced many possible software options.

The system requires quite a bit of up front learning and set up, but once it's in place it works beautifully. It also integrates with our citywide financial system (Munis) for payroll and has made payroll imports a breeze in comparison to previous imports. The system is not cheap, but is scalable depending on the size of your organization.\n\n\nThe City of Las Cruces (NM) Fire Department has been using Telestaff for all staffing and unit deployment in emergency and non-emergency situations for approximately 8 years.
