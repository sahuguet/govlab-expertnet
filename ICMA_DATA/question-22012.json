Off budget cycle requests typically go to a Board or Commission (i.e. Parks and Recreation Commission if the request is sports related).  That Board or Commission makes a recommendation and then it is taken up at a Council meeting for Council consideration.  There is not a pot of funds, so funding must come from cost savings or fund balances.\n\n\nMost requests are done during the budget process and officially requested by the organization.

However, in the wake of the indictment and removal of three commissioners and a grand jury investigation, the Commission ended the practice on Dec. 15, 2009, as well as at the same time establishing a Commission of Ethics and Inspector General's Office to oversee future county actions.\n\n\nPrior to December 2009, Palm Beach County, FL, Commissioners had \"discretionary spending accounts\" which allowed them to fund projects based on merit or need in their districts, outside of the Budget process.

We decided to formalize our process and now each summer, we prepare an application packet and send to agencies already funded and ask them to submit any planned funding request they anticipate for our upcoming fiscal year.  Once received, staff reviews the applications for completeness and makes a recommendation to City Council through our normal budgetary process in the fall.  Now, any mid-year requests we receive we simply refer to our application process and deal with at that time.  Its a more efficient and purposeful approach since we see all requests at one time now.\n\n\nThe City used to get such funding requests throughout the year, typically when a particular local organization's fiscal year was nearing the end, which didn't always mesh well with our fiscal year.
