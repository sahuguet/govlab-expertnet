We share the information publicly on our website and leverage more features internally through the vendor provided website at GPSinsight.  I initiated the program when I was the Asst. PW Director and worked with our GIS staff to develop the AVL mapping portion.  I\u2019d be happy to discuss the project details/costs with you further if you have an interest. \nFor AVL sight info, go to:  \nhttp://gis.hudson.oh.us/HudsonSL/ Go to the Applications pull down menu on the top right tool bar, and then select AVL. You should be able to view real time vehicle data.\n\n\nKristoffer:\n\nWe (City of Hudson, Ohio) implemented a GPS snow plow program about 6 years ago, and then quickly expanded it to include the remaining PW vehicles.
