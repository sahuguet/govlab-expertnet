Originally branded the \"Town Council Road Show,\" we then ended up calling it \"Your Town Connection.\" In the first years, Town Council went out to five locations and met with the public. Then, we pared that back to three. Attendance varied pretty widely. The events were popular if there was a particularly contentious issue happening within the community. Otherwise, it could be pretty sparse. Free food always helps to draw people, as do door prizes (we purchased gifts from local businesses and raffled those off). We gave updates on upcoming projects, answered questions, etc. (All Town department heads were there to answer questions in their respective areas.) Once the economy turned, budgets became a problem, and we couldn't justify holding events with free food, etc. -- especially given the sometimes sparse attendance. We tried \"tagging\" the concept onto other events by putting up a \"Your Town Connection\" tent at an outdoor movie night or a \"doggie dip\" event at the pool. People at those events just weren't very receptive to talking to Town Council. So, starting in 2010, we suspended the program. Hopefully this is relevant and helps.

This is different from public hearings where everyone in the whole community is welcome to come and talk about the subject at hand.  The Neighborhood Listening Sessions would only occur in certain parts of the community and these people would be invited to come and voice their opions, problems, and ideas to a group of Village employess from all areas.  \nDoes anyone else do this?  Are there promotional tools out there?  Is there is a feedback form?  What works and what doesn't work?\n\n",
