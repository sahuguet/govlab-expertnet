  "text": "\n\nWe are looking for RFP templates for Food & Beverage vendors to provide service at our new golf course clubhouse. This could be as small as a snack bar with a 60-seat area or as large as a small restaurant. We are in the process of designing a new clubhouse and community building for our municipal golf course with the kitchen area left undesigned pending the selection of a food vendor to provide the appropriate layout. A budget will be set for the fixtures and equipment. Thank you.\n\n",
