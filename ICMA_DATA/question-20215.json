They do this specifically to prevent careless drivers from impeding the flow of traffic, but this could easily be modified to specifically mention the necessity of only parking in properly-designated spaces.\n2)  The National Park Service has a valuable document in this regard, from their Bird Island Basin park in Texas.  This set of regulations (available on the Knowledge Network here: http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/301503/Bird_Island_Basin_Parking_Regulations) specifies that of the 114 parking spaces at the boat ramp itself, 106 of them are designated as vehicle/trailer ONLY, and can never be used in any other way; they have a separate lot for that.\n3)  Finally, the city of Santa Barbara CA has regulations in place which only specify vehicle/trailer parking only; they call these \u201cyellow diamond parking spaces,\u201d and will ticket people without trailers using those spots (http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/Resident/Transportation_and_Parking/Waterfront/Main+Harbor+Lot.htm).  By charging different rates of parking for vehicles with trailers, it seems they figure the higher costs of the yellow diamond spaces will ensure compliance with the regulations. \nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Tracy:\n\nIn searching online, I have found several starting points for the city of South Daytona that are worth taking a look into:\n\n1)  The Handbook of Delaware Boating Laws and Responsibilities (http://www.boat-ed.com/de/handbook/br_10_ramps.htm) has a short entry regarding the proper use of parking lots; in section 3 regarding parking lots, they simply tailor the rules to prevent people from parking in undesignated parking space.

  "text": "\n\nThe city of South Daytona is looking to locate ordinances that restrict vehicles from parking in designated spaces for boats and trailers at a boat ramp facility.  The city currently has spaces designed for vehicles and trailers and other spaces specifically for regular vehicles without trailers.  Please provide any ordinances you have that govern this specific use of a parking space.  Respond here or directly to tmiller@transformgov.org.\n\n",
