The recession may have slowed the advance of government retirements but time always catches up. There will be tremendous opportunity for our generation to reshape the government/taxpayer relationship but you have to be patient in order to persevere. \nOn a more practical level, try setting up informational interviews with agencies you are interested in working with.
