For an example, if elderly population are growing in the city and young people are leaving the city, this may affect the city revenue generation since more medical facilities are needed. . However, education and crime levels are good indicators of a city's wellbeing.  I do not agree that credit rating should be an indicator. For example, many can have poor credit ratings due to medical problems or people that are in between jobs.  What about unemployment rates that can also drive a person to bankruptcy, hence poor credit rating. Although unemployment rate alone can be a good indicator of a city's fiscal health, sometimes with this economy, it is hard to find jobs for many qualified folks. \nI think a city ranking should be based on education, manufacturing indusries and unemployment rate.\n\n\nI think a city's economic standards can be judged based on various standards offered by the ICMA guide lines.

  "text": "\n\nMany of you may have seen this.  Wall Street 24-7 (an online financial news resource) recently compiled a list of best and worst run American cities.  The rankings were largely based on education, poverty and crime levels.  Credit rating was also an important component.  \nDo people agree/disagree with the rankings?
