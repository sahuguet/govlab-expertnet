Scenario planning has been at the core of our work in ICMA's Leading Practice of \"Fiscal Health\" and we'd encourage you to contact ICMA's Center for Management Strategies Director, Cheryl Hilvert (chilvert@icma.org) and we could set up a web-meeting to demonstrate exactly what you're talking about - scenario planning your financial forecast for worst-case (and best-case) scenarios.\nYou'd enjoy \u201cExcelling in Times of Fiscal Distress,\u201d an article Bob O'Neill wrote for Governing, in October 2008. He wrote \u201cMost of us can articulate the early-warning signs that preceded the current economic downturn: Global forces that dramatically changed the local, state, and federal playing fields. Skyrocketing fuel costs. A failing housing market\u2026property tax limitations. Yet, many of us failed to correctly interpret these early-warning signs in relation to their impact on our government organizations.\u201d\nInterpretation is the key. In your case, interpreting the impact of a major employer closing down, for instance, and what the true impact would be on your organization and community.\nThe major \"tool\" we've been working on is a data-visualization tool that depicts real-time impacts of various scenarios with a financial impact. So if the major employer closes down, what impact would it have on your \"ongoing\" revenues and expenses, and what impacts would it have on your \"one-time\" sources and uses of funds. Furthermore, what actions or initiatives are being considered to deal with this situation that would also have an impact (for instance, if there are any incentives on the table that could serve as an economic development strategy; tax abatement; TIF, etc, or re-investing in development, urban renewal, or recruitment to address attracting new businesses).\nFor all of these related activities, you want to be able to model the situation, demonstrate the impacts, and appropriately weigh the impacts of various decisions. that's what Fiscal Health modeling is all about.\nFiscal Health modeling is a powerful scenario-planning tool, providing easy to understand visualization of data. \n--- Elected officials have adopted Fiscal Health as their preferred means of communicating with staff regarding any decisions brought before them that potentially might have a fiscal impact \u2013 asking staff to \u201cshow us\u201d those impacts using the principles of Fiscal Health as the primary communication device.\n--- Organizations have entered into labor negotiations with their bargaining units using Fiscal Health as a way to quickly agree on the assumptions behind the City\u2019s fiscal forecasts, therefore establishing a basis of trust in the discussion \u2013 then modeling the bargaining units\u2019 requests to demonstrate impacts to the City\u2019s fiscal position.\n--- It has even been used to help a Water and Sewer District prioritize capital projects, understand the ongoing impacts of those projects, and effectively develop rate increases by better understanding their ongoing and one-time sources and uses of funding in their operation.\nThanks Jeff - hope this is helpful. We're motivated by the exact type of objective you seem to have in your strategic planning (and how to bring the financial picture in the discussion), and look forward to sharing experiences.\nChris Fabian\n\n\nHI Jeffrey - we just posted to the ICMA's Center for Management Strategies blog, based entirely on your question: \n\nhttp://fiscalhealthandwellness.blogspot.com/2013/04/fiscal-health-your-strategic-plan-for.html\n\nVery cool that you're headed down this path with your strategic planning.
