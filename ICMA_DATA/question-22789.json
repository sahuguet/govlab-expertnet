Several years ago we completed a cost of services study to determine direct and indirect costs for all the services we provide.  It is updated each year and as a result, some of our fees are adjusted.  Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions.  http://dublinohiousa.gov/events/event-guidebook-event-application/\n\n\nMercy - Here is a link to the City of Dublin, Ohio event permit page.
