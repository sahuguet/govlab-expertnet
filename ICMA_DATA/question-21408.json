  "text": "\n\nSection 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 contains a provision that requires that federal, state, and local governments withhold 3% from nearly all contract payments for goods and services. If it is not repealed the 3% withholding provision will effect payments made after December 31, 2012. \nHow would this requirement impact operations in your government? Will it impact cash flow and hiring decisions, or will it be a significant paperwork and reporting nightmare?\nFor more information: http://icma.org/en/Page/100279/3_Withholding_Requirement\n\n",
