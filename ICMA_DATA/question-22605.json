A bad manager can ruin things either way.\nHaving said that, Internal Service Funds offers you an opportunity to directly operate as a fee-for-service entity.  This can have the benefit of focusing management on productivity/billable hours and away from just administration of budgets.\nThe Fee-for-Service approach allows you to directly match costs against private sector providers on an apples to apples basis. If your operation is cheaper that private alternatives in equivalent service delivery you have strong indications of superior performance. Likewise, if your internal service costs are higher, you have a clear indication of a need to evaluate you operations to gain efficiency and effectiveness.\nIn the end, it does always come down to having the right people on the bus.\n\n\nEfficiency and effectiveness really are more a result of managerial ability, than accounting fund placement.

      "text": "\n\nHillsborough County (FL) started down the path to an internal service fund for IT services several years ago \u2013 similar to what we had already done for fleet maintenance and employee health insurance. From a cost accounting standpoint, it is a good approach to setting internal charges that reflect the cost of services. We opted, however, to leave IT in the General Fund. An internal service fund would have added cost to track data needed to calculate those IT charges and institute regular billings to other County departments, and the cost of them evaluating those charges. Instead, we take the costs of all of the central support functions in the General Fund and allocate them though an annual cost allocation plan with similar results but a lot less effort. We are still able to recover costs from other funding sources, and we still have sufficient detail on these overhead costs to factor into the calculation of user fees to external customers. What we avoid is the need to spend more administrative resources billing departments, having them verify the bills, and internally processing numerous inter-organizational charges.\n\n\nHillsborough County (FL) started down the path to an internal service fund for IT services several years ago \u2013 similar to what we had already done for fleet maintenance and employee health insurance.

  "text": "\n\nI was thinking of looking into the question of whether IT departments are more efficient and effective if they operate as a general fund department or within an Internal Service Fund. I've heard a lot of strong opinions for both side of the argument, but I've never seen a correlation study on the subject. Does anyone know of anything out there?\nThanks,\nAlan\n\n",
