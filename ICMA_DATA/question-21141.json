Does anyone have any thoughts based on his or her experiences as to what would constitiute their \"ideal structure\" (e.g., non-profit EDC; stand alone County dept; ED function a division blended into the Planning/Development dept or the like; an authority; etc)? Also, what mix of occupations/talents/company reps. would you have on an ideal advisory board or governing board?\nThanks.\n\n",
