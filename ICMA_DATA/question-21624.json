Your organization needs to determine 1) the audience (e.g., the citizens, the elected officials, the staff); and 2) use of the reporting (e.g., overall health of the organization; the success of delivery of particular services; budget vs. actual revenue and spending analysis; CORE services performance, etc.)  Until you have decided on the two elements above you will not be able to tell your organizations \"story\", which is what you ultimate goal is for making you performance measures work for you.\n\n\nRachel, The most difficult part of Performance Measurement is deciding what to do with the data you have collected.

It reminds me, also, that it's a good idea to identify the goals of your organization (by department) first, and then try to answer this question: how do we know if we're meeting our goals?  I think that process helps to ensure that your measures don't get too narrowly focused (often times I think we only measure what's easy to measure, regardless of how meaningful it is).\n\n\nStephen makes an excellent point.

  "text": "\n\nOur city is preparing to roll out performance measures for 2012.  We are hoping to gain a better understanding of the quality and efficiency of our services as well as have more data driven discussions with both council memebers and citizens.  Eventually we would like to benchmark ourselves with other communities.  So far the hardest part seems to be developing those key performance indicators that actually determines what you measure.  Has anyone else developed performance measures for their Parks and Recreation Departments or Customer Service Departments?  Were certain measures more helpful/reliable than others?  Any response is helpful as we embark on this journey.  Thanks!\n\n",
