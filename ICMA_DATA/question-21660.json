  "text": "\n\nOur city is currently in the process of mapping out a new IT strategic plan.  We are using Google Apps Cloud computing for a free 30 day trial to see how that option will work within our organization.  Though the Cloud computing sees like a really great solution to many of our IT needs, we are still slightly concerned about about security and some of the limitiations invloved.  Has anyone had experience using Cloud computing?  If so what company/software did you use?  Any suggestions would be helpful as we do not have a IT person on staff.\nThanks in advance!!\nRachel\n\n",
