  "text": "\n\nHow do you engage and inform your \"non-digital\" citizens?  They may be senior citizens without computers or a desire to use them. Or they may be computer-savvy people who simply don't subscribe to email, facebook or visit your website for information.  Providing our citizens with all the information in the world doesn't help if they can't (or won't) receive it.  Sending out printed newsletters becomes costly & time consuming, and it doesn't get citizens the \"latest\" info.\n\n",
