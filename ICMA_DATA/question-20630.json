Partnering with Google will allow us to be able to provide email storage at a much cheaper cost than the purchasing of additional servers.  We believe their redundancy, security and filtering is also far superior to that which we would want to pay for.  We have also found great benefit in the collaborative nature of cloud processing.  When we have documents that need several authors, such as legal documents, we initiate those in Google docs and then when complete simply migrate over to Word (if we need to).  The collaboration tool on docs is so much better than redline and markup on Word.  We have also begun to use many features like Google maps and spreadsheet, along with API's to replace separate systems such as web mapping and capital  budgets, to name a few.  We look forward to replacing several unique, stand-alone software systems in our city with Google Apps, due to it versatility.  We have had a great experience with this feature and no that it is only limited by our own imagination.  The only down-side is that Google has a tendency to change things around without much notice, which has caused us some frustration and there isn't too much on the support side.  The program however is not difficult and so most concerns can be handled in house.  I hope this helps.\n\n\nWashington City, Utah has been a Google Apps government for approximately a year and a half and we are fans.

The report deals directly with a variety of open source and other software for local governments, but many of the case studies look into the specific benefits and concerns for Google apps. There are also numerous case studies cited (D.C., LA, Portland, San Francisco, etc) to give you an idea of how municipalities implemented the switch to Google Apps across their separate offices and agencies. I would definitely recommend you give it a read.\nDerek Johnson\nhttp://bit.ly/cXHwPf\n\n\nKevin,\n\nThis past year our Knowledge Network administrator Michael Repas wrote a report on this very subject.

We currently have 10 people on a Federal network for E-mail purposes and 4 employees on a jury-rigged email server. The conversion is happening this week to convert everyone into Google email archiving and servicing. We have new email addresses that are .org addresses, but they live in the Google cloud. Google archives all emails prior to it getting to our inboxes, so we never have to worry about deleting the wrong email, because the cloud has already captured it.\nHow the retrieval process will work still needs to be clarified, but we will see about it. The other thing that I am excited about is the ability to collaborate on Documents in the 'cloud' and will have to give it a few months before making a decision on the pro's and con's.\n\n\nMy organization is in the midst of converting to Google Mail and Google Apps for our 14 employees.

After this step we will begin to evaluate email cloud either through Microsoft, or Google.  Initial thoughts are that since all employees are currently using the MS Outlook product we may need to continue down that path.  We do intend to take a look at Google.  I would appreciate the thoughts, concerns, or issues that any jurisdiction had if they moved from the Mircrosoft platform to the Google system.\n\n\nWe are currently beginning a migration process to cloud computing.
