  "text": "\n\nI was talking with the City Manager for the City of Elmhurst, Illinois this morning and it appears that the City will be undergoing strategic planning this summer. He has tasked me with finding existing RFPs for strategic planning consultant services in the area. Does anyone have any idea where I could find such RFPs for neighboring communities? I found a few non-profit RFPs as well as two library district RFPs for a strategic planning consultant on the ICMA website, but no luck with municipal RFPs. Thanks!\nBest Regards,\nKevin Leighty\nAdministrative Intern\n\n",
