  "text": "\n\nWould anyone have any experience with a research based consultant who is good with numbers and community engagement? We are preparing a report for a study we'd like to do in regards to 211 services in our community and we'd like it to be a mix of qualitative and quantitative date which includes, in meaningful and relevant ways, our stakeholders which includes service providers, funders and service clients. Any advice on whom other communities have used for studies like this would be tremendously helpful. I'm trying to create a list of potential consultants/research firms we can reach out to in order to understand cost, processes, timing, etc.\n\n",
