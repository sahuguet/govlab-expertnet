It's worth going through them as each agency posts job openings. Depending on what your interests are, this can be a start. Keep in mind that agencies in NYC are large organizations. So for example, say you're interested in a budget analyst position, you can first look at the Office of Management and Budget or agencies like Parks & Recreation as they have an OMB component. Secondly, you may also want to look for positions in borough presidents' offices, as many will have analysts positions. Below is the website for the Manhattan Borough President: http://www.mbpo.org/\nDon't forget to look at the other boroughs, i.e, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and if you have to - Staten Island. Third, you may want to look at any job boards in city papers such as the Gotham Gazette and City Limits, links are below:\nhttp://www.gothamgazette.com/\nhttp://www.citylimits.org/jobs\nLastly, browsing craigslist may be helpful. I've seen many agencies and elected offices, i.e, council, assembly, senate, post positions there.  While these suggestions are mostly for positions in city government, you can also look at state agencies, Port Authority, and federal agencies, HUD, as most have offices in NYC. Good luck in your search\n\n\nFor starters, you may want to look at the city's website: http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/?front_door=true\nOn the left, you will find a drop down menu bar for all the agencies in the city.
