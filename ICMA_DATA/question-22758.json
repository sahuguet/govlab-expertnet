      "text": "\n\nHi Maggie, \nBrava to you for thinking about orientation for committee members vs. throwing them into the committee work and letting them fend for themselves! I've never led an orientation for municipal committee members; my experience is leading orientation for new employees and sitting on committees myself. However, I feel like the principles are the same, so here my two cents: \n-Give them information that will make them feel successful going into the meetings. Are acronyms throw out with reckless abandon? Then give them a cheat sheet. Is there a hierarchy that they should be familiar with? Then give them an org. chart. Are Roberts Rules of Order the norm? Then tell them the basics. \n-Send them the orientation agenda ahead of time, showing that there will be time at the end for answering questions. When you send the agenda, encourage them to think ahead of time about what questions they might have. When the time comes during orientation for answering those questions, start off by asking \"what questions can I answer for you?\" vs. \"Does anyone have any questions?\" It sounds like semantics, but the first way of asking makes it clear that it's okay for them to have questions and that you're ready and willing to answer them. \n-Set clear expectations of what being a committee member will entail. Is each person responsible for chairing or sitting on a sub-committee? Are there positions that need to be filled from people rotating off the committee (e.g. someone to turn in the committee's annual report, someone to update web content, someone to track attendance)? How many meetings are they expected to attend? Do they need to tell anyone if they're not going to make a meeting? \n-Tell them who and what their resources are. If they have questions, do they come to you? If they need a tool to get their work done, do they purchase it and seek reimbursement? Are there by-laws that they need to know? (Here's an example of by-laws for a community choir that has a board and some committees:  http://www.lawrencecivicchoir.org/members/by-laws/ ) \nAs far as time goes, I think once you determine your orientation content, you'll have a better sense of the time it will take to discuss that information. That said, if you can keep it to an hour or an hour and a half, I think that's ideal. If you need to go longer than that, make sure that you build in breaks and/or time to get up and stretch and meet other people in the room. \nOne more resource for you - I was at a conference exhibit hall a little bit ago and saw that Kansas State University has a board leadership training course they do:  http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/boardleadership/ . I know you said committee, but their board resources might be ripe for extrapolation. \nAgain, kudos to you for thinking about providing orientation. The fact that you're even thinking about that means that you're aware that committee members don't simply arrive knowing how to be effective. \nAlecia Gray \nKU Public Management Center \nagray@ku.edu\n\n\nHi Maggie, \nBrava to you for thinking about orientation for committee members vs. throwing them into the committee work and letting them fend for themselves!
