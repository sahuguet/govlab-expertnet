I know they passed a policy on service pricing and I have included the links below.  I hope it helps!\nhttp://www.newmarket.ca/en/townhall/feesandcharges.asp?mid=507\nhttp://www.newmarket.ca/en/townhall/resources/2153855_my_two_cents",

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Peoria is looking to develop recommendations for a Cost of Service (Cost Recovery) Fee Policy related to our development services activities (Planning, Engineering, Building).  Currently, we recover approximately 50-55% of the direct, indirect and overhead costs associated with these activities.  I have been asked to look at fee policies (formal or informal) from other cities to get a general sense of the cost recovery thresholds given today's economic climate.  I would assume that most cities strive for 100% cost recovery on these type of services, with some exceptions for compliance permits, pre-applications, etc.  If you have actual policies to share, I would appreciate it, otherwise just a comment about your approach to setting these fees.  Thanks!\n\n",
