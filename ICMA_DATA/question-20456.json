I do not have a facebook page as i like to fly under the radar as much as possible.  I have looked at others facebook pages and social media sites to gain background on the person.  I have been shocked at what i have seen on some of them.  I would suggest that anyone establishing a social media site adhere to a rule i read somewhere.  That is; would you want your grandmother seeing or reading what is on your site?  if you do it, keep it as vanilla as possible.\n\n\nMy wife and I were just discussing this last night.

If you're thinking of having a Facebook page as the city manager of your city and use it for professional and work related purposes, it may be best to consider a webpage for the entire organization and serve as an administrator. Many cities have Facebook pages already. Its a delicate line you have to tread whether you have it for personal or professional purposes. I agree with Mr. Brice, keep it as vanilla as possible. Really take a look and understand the profile and privacy settings on your Facebook page or any other social media platform. I do have a facebook page but really use it on a limited basis. In the end its about how comfortable you are with the technology.\n\n\nAsk yourself why you want to have a Facebook or other social media page?

What do you want to achieve with your Facebook presence? If it is for professional purposes? If you have a job like city manager where there are always political implications, then your Facebook presence cannot include intimate details about your personal life or family. Always be professional about what you post. Don't be vanilla, but do be prudent. I hope more local government officials and managers use social media to explain and explore the challenges they face in a way their citizens can understand. Ask your visitors questions and engage them through social media. You might even get some helpful answers. At the very least, you show them that you are thinking about ways to make their city operate better, and you do not have to contend with the media filter. Social media enable public contact, with all of its potential for helpful and not so helpful consequences.\n\n\nAlthough I am also over the age 50 hill, I think a Facebook page is a great idea for public sector leaders, with some really clear caveats.

      "text": "\n\nEven though I'm 23 years old and use Facebook heavily for social reasons, I'm not convinced having a page dedicated specifically to the City Manager is a good idea.  Chalfont Borough's Melissa Shafer just posted a question about having issues with citizens using a Youth Committee page to express political opinions, and I'm afraid that's what a City Manager's page would turn into all too quickly.  And any attempt to block such users could be interpreted as censorship and get blown way out of proportion.  If a City Manager wants to engage in social media and be accessible to the public in that way, I would recommend that he consider Twitter instead.  That way, the words that appear on his on his page are merely his own and any responses they solicit remain only on the responders' pages.  Then, the City Manager can receive feedback from his followers more discreetly and keep the overall \"demeanor\" of his page fresh and positive.\n\n\nEven though I'm 23 years old and use Facebook heavily for social reasons, I'm not convinced having a page dedicated specifically to the City Manager is a good idea.

Individuals (elected officials and managers) may not always speak with the same voice, the same intent, or the same opinion.  This is dangerous and anyone practicing this should ensure to have a plan in place to pick up the pieces when things go bad.  Our social networking covers events, road closures, human interest, photo and video...we encourage comments from citizens about matters to a legal degree - and engage those citizens with a single voice.  Speaking of legal, when in FL, one or more counsel members whose comments interact (even inadvertantly) is a violation of FL Sunshine Law.\nElected officials and City Managers have a grey area between their personal and professional lives and not only would they most likely cross, it could cause difficulty with the elected body.   Everyone has a right to a personal social networking presence, but where would you draw the line?  In real life, a CM must choose friends wisely, in the social media world, it is a daunting task. \nNow, having a CM blog on the City Website is a better suited application if the CM wants to make a point, express an idea, or interact with folks.\n\n\nI am with Lauren and Daniel on this one.

For me, it's a study in ethics and living a responsible life in all aspects. So while I appreciate individual's choices for compartmentalizing their lives, I have chosen to NOT do that.

So for a CM to turn their back on the possibilities for civic engagement that Facebook and this new social media brings, I think is short-sighted and limits a CM from reaching all constituents.
