Interestingly, the Council recently asked why we were bringing a $500 Target (National Night Out) grant to them for approval. They asked us to look into revising the policy so that simple grants would not require council acceptance. I will most likely propose a policy change where council approval would not be necessary for those grants under $10,000 and/or those requiring no match.\n\n\nBullhead City, AZ also takes all grants to the City Council for final approval.

In terms of state and/or Foundation grants, the requirements are widely varied.  The point here is that it is imporant to keep in mind that regardless of local policy or practice, there may be a need to carry out an approval process imposed by the funder that is different from the local policy.  Also, I have worked in circumstances where local governments have created nonprofit corporations (primarily for economic development related) that expands the capacity and scope of pursuing grants.  In most instances involving the nonprofit corporation, the general practice was to secure the Mayor's sign off (even in Council-Manager) .\n\n\nIn terms of most federal agencies, there is a standard requirement for the local governing body to approve especially where there is a fiduciary set of obligations and/or local match of some form.
