      "text": "\n\nMark, the City of Brooklyn Park MN established a sister city relationship with Kakata (in Margibi County), Liberia in July 2012.  The relationship was initiated through the efforts of a committee of Liberian community members in and around Brooklyn Park.  Our area has one of the largest concentrations of Liberians outside the Republic of Liberia.  The local committee acts as the intermediary for communications and coordination of activities.  The recognition of the relationship is more than city-to-city as it works to leverage relationships with higher ed institutions and other resources in the community.  Please let me know if there is more information that would be beneficial for what you are researching.\nThank you.\nJamie Verbrugge\nCity Manager\n\n\nMark, the City of Brooklyn Park MN established a sister city relationship with Kakata (in Margibi County), Liberia in July 2012.
