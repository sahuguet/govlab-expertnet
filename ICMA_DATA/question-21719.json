  "text": "\n\nI am examing our organizational structure and have been asked to review the compensation plan.  One of the questions I am being asked is what is an approriate difference between different categories of employees.  For example, how much more should the City Manager be compensated above the Department Directors, how much more should Department Directors be compensated abve mid-managers, etc.  Are there any recent published resources which address this issue and discuss what are typical differences that I could access or which someone could share with me.\n\n",
