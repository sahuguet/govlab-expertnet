  "text": "\n\nI recently began to manage a small City who has some serious GIS needs, however, is restricted (as we all are) on how much we can expend to get such a project off the ground. We have partnered with nearby communities who will share the base map information, however, need information on maintenance, etc. Does anyone have any insight to share on a GIS deployment in a small city, (less than 10K population)? Any insight is appreciated!\nThanks,\nSylvia\n\n",
