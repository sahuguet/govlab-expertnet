Beyond that, most of the center\u2019s measures focus on individual departments (police, fire, highways, parks) or outcomes (sustainability, employee satisfaction).\nAmong the measures that have been used by various local governments are those that are goal-specific (e.g., completion of a key capital improvement on a pre-set timeline, satisfactory resolution of labor or economic development negotiations), process-specific (relating to budget calendars, citizen-inquiry responsiveness, process streamlining), or internally focused (employee development, evaluation and retention; responsiveness to council referrals).  The danger with some such measures, of course, is that they boil down a complex task into a simple question of workload.\nSome jurisdictions also use \u201cmeta-measures\u201d for management, looking at how they are driving change within the organization.  The City of San Jose, California, for instance, has measured the manager\u2019s performance on the percentage of core services meeting or exceeding levels established by the council, the percentage using formal customer feedback mechanisms to improve service delivery, and the percentage exceeding cycle time targets.\nAnother good resource is the city of Vancouver, Wash.  While the city manager\u2019s goals are stated in summary form, each department (including financial and management services) has a scorecard that details its progress against goals and discusses any issues encountered.  Looking at longer-range management, they have also encouraged departments to adopt multi-year business plans, and allow for streamlined consideration of budget requests if they are part of those plans.  \nhttp://www.cityofvancouver.us/performance.asp?menuid=10462&submenuID=17767&itemID=17770\n\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement\u2019s General Government survey collects data on citizen satisfaction with regard to all jurisdiction services.
