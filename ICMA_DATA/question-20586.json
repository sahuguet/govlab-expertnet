It's long but worth a read. \nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1145/is_6_36/ai_76550355/\nMoreover, ICMA's Center for Performance Measurement page and Parks and Recreation topic page are both good places to start if you're looking for ideas and/or wish to communicate with those directly involved in those fields. For example, here is a CPM case study of performance measure strategies for 8 separate parks and recreation departments throughout the country. \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/2714/What_Works_2002_Parks__Recreation\nICMA Center for Performance Measurement: http://icma.org/en/results/center_for_performance_measurement/about\nParks and Recreation Topic Page: http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/190/Parks_and_Recreation\nThis should be enough to get you started.

      "text": "\n\nHi Colin\nYou have asked an interesting question but you might want to separate the question.  Civic engagement is very different from marketing and while both are important you will probably get different answers/performance measures.  Marketing is the selling or advocacy of an idea or program and you are wanting to know how successful you were in that endeavor.  Civic engagement is about developing a process to get to a decision.  I would suggest that you not try to formally measure civic engagement efforts initially.  I have some ideas on how to judge the quality/success of civic engagement so feel free to contact me.

  "text": "\n\nI am developing a framework for developing quality civic engagement/marketing communications programs for park and recreation organizations and am interested in best practices of other jurisdictions.  Do you currently have performance measures in place to understand how well programs are working?  Are you regularly evaluating whether your social media sites are successfully reaching the intended audience?  Which evaluation tools/performance measures are most effective, relevant, and userful?\nI'd be interested in any measures you currently have in place, and would like to know how well it's working.  If you don't have measures in place, why?  I recently conducted an informal survey among park and recreation professionals in Washington state and found that very few have performance measures or specific goals for Web 2.0 tools, and my assumption is that measures do not exist for more traditional marketing communications methods either.  Your responses may be used in a chapter of a book discussing the implications of use of Web 2.0 tools in government agencies.\n\n",
