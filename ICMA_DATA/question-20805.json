I couldn't find a list of counties exempted from sales taxes on good that are necessary to run their governments. But with assistance from NACo, I am posting the following Georgia law that exempts counties from sales taxes. I assume other states have similarities to this one:  https://etax.dor.ga.gov/salestax/TLP_2010_List_of_Sales_and_Use_Tax_Exemptions.pdf \nIn addition, the following is from New York which exempts its counties:  http://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/purchases_and_sales_by_governmental_entities.htm \nI hope this helps.\n\n\nHi Pamela, \nFrom the question, I'm assuming what is meant are counties that do not pay sales taxes to the state on items that they purchase.
