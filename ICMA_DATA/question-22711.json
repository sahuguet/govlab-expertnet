This includes questions like \u201cHow do you think other people experience you?\u201d, Tell me about a time when you were able to put yourself in another\u2019s place to understand their position before you made an important decision?  How would your coworkers say you react to stress? What would they notice different in your behavior?  What do you try to moderate or minimize when you are under stress?  Who are your best friends at work and what are the relationships based upon? If you could attend a full day seminar in an area to improve your skills at work, what subject would you chose? Tell us about a time when you made a decision and it was misinterpreted?  Tell us about the best day you have had at work and what happened that day?  Tell us about the traits of the best manager you have ever worked for and examples of how you have embraced those traits.  Same question for worst with rejecting instead of embracing. You can use some of these same questions as you talk with references and compare the responses.\nHope that is helpful.\nDavid Donaldson\nAssistant City Manager\nCity of Lake Oswego\nPO Box 369\nLake Oswego, OR 97034\n(503) 699-7451\nddonaldson@ci.oswego.or.us\nMary:  My approach has been to try to ask questions and evaluate answers through the five key traits of emotional intelligence: Empathy, Motivation, Reaction to Stress, Social Skills, and Self Awareness.
