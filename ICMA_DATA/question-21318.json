For example, Minneapolis cut the time it took to remediate graffiti from 2-3 weeks to 2-3 days when they gave Public Works employees digital cameras to take pictures of the graffiti for the Police Department rather than wait until an officer could be sent out to take a picture.  Indianapolis routinely uses a Six Sigma process as part of its IndyStat program and was able to cut the number of steps in the process for repairing potholes from 25 to 12.  \nBeyond the opportunity to improve efficiency and service delivery, a processes audit/review will aid the city by documenting what processes actually are.  In far too many cases, there is no documentation of the business processes as all that information resides in a key employee's head.  By mapping out those processes and recording them, the local government can retain that corporate knowledge should the employee retire or move on to another position.\nI can pull together the names of a few consultants who do this kind of work and e-mail them to you if you like.\n\n\nA lot of communities that have implemented a 311/CRM system have gone through a business processes audit/review as part of their back-end work before the system goes live or as part of their continuous improvement efforts.
