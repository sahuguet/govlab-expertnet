      "text": "\n\nLee, just some advice from what I\u2019ve seen when regional strategies were proposed.  The best results for integration to a county-wide service delivery strategy is to take the time in the beginning to discuss the vision of what a leading edge police force could look like if they could meet specific benchmarks five to ten years out.  Come at this from the perspective of a Cities of the Future concept.  The reason being that you know what you have today but will that be effective for the next generation of socially connected communities that will have more stay at home businesses, more urban oriented redevelopment that support sustainable community concepts, greater reliance on security systems (location cameras, red light cameras, building security, and so on), and will community policing strategies with more on the ground (bicycles, walking) not vehicle based roaming teams that advocate more enhanced community relations be part of this solution?   \nI am an advocate for regional solutions and encourage you to proceed aggressively in performing a visioning exercise that will meet your county\u2019s \u201cstretch goals\u201d and progressive expectations ten years out.  Setting these goals early will allow you to plan to establish a broader foundation from which to build add-ons to your existing strategy from inception.  It will also set expectations early so that decisions to revise job descriptions, possibly expand the non-uniformed staff to fill certain community relations goals, and potentially leverage the business community by understanding their expectations so they can advocate your goals to the broader public, you will have more support behind the county\u2019s plans and a greater chance of success.   \nFinally, when it comes to the labor agreements, if you have the vision document before you when you begin negotiating policy, service levels, coverage, IT systems requirements, and 10 year goals with union staff regarding qualifications, skill levels, and training expectations to achieve the future county vision, the dynamics of that discussion will be more in managements favor.   \nI hope you find this helpful. \nBill Gilmore \nWilliam B.
