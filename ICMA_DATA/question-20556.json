None of them were aware of any kind of codes or laws that regulate the use of heat treatment devices for bed bug infestations. It may be the case that there are other localities that have enacted similar regulatory policies, but there is no guidance in terms of state and federal resources to point to. So to a certain extent, if your city is considering regulations or codes for these devices, you would be in something of an uncharted territory in that regard.  \nI spoke with Robert Pereira, a professor of entomology at the University of Florida who conducted an experiment and wrote a report on portable heat treatment devices for bed bug infestations. According to him, one way to ensure safe use of these devices may be not so much in regulation of the heat treatment devices themselves, but rather the pest control professionals that operate them.   \nHere's a partial transcript of the answer he gave me when I asked your question:  \n\"Regulations for pest control usually deals with pesticides. For devices there is usually nothing on the books. Here in Florida, people that offer professional services as a pest control operator, they have to be licensed to do that kind of thing. So if I decide to apply pesticides in my house I don't need a license, but if I do offer my services to others, I would need a pest control license. Personally I don't think there is a need [for regulating heat treatment] if the person follows some standard of service.   \nIn other words, industry standards (and ensuring that local companies follow them) may be your best route to ensuring that heat treatment devices are used responsibly and safely in your buildings.   \nI've attached a copy of the University of Florida report as well as an accompanying journal article about it. They may be worth reading to get a sense for how these devices are used and what potential safety issues they may have. Be aware that the device they use is smaller and less powerful than the ones used by most pest control companies.  \nHere is Professor Roberto Pereira's contact information if you would like to speak to him yourself. He has said he would be willing to answer any questions you might have on this matter:  \nRoberto M. Pereira, Ph.D.  \nAssociate Research Scientist  \nUrban Entomology Laboratory  \nEntomology & Nematology Dept.  \nUniversity of Florida  \nPO Box 110620  \nBldg. 970 Natural Area Drive   \nGainesville, FL 32611-0620  \nUSA  \nOffice: (352) 392-2326  \nCell: (352) 226-3886  \nAnother good source may be Steven Kells, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has also done research into heat methods. I don't have his phone number but I do have his e-mail address, it may be worthwhile to contact him. \nKells002@umn.edu \nFurther, the Environmental Protection Agency holds an annual national bed bug summit where all kinds of ideas about managing and regulating the bed bug problem are discussed and researched. Their next conference is (tentatively) scheduled for January 19th and 20th in Washington D.C.. Here's the website from last year's summit:   http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/ppdc/bedbug-summit/ \nHope this helps, Kim.
