  "text": "\n\nThe City of Ferndale is looking to develop a policy that considers modern and future mobile environments.  Historically, the City has not had a written staff cell phone use and renewal policy.  The City will likely consider a BYOD approach as city technology and telecommunication systems and foundations become more developed.  In short, the city needs to crawl before we can run.  \nThat being said, are other cities able to share a cell phone use and purchase/renewal policy that has been implemented and managed well throughout their organization?  \nThanks in advance for any sample policy or input you might provide!\n\n",
