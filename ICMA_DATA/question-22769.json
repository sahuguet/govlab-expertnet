      "text": "\n\nKris, regarding your specific question about flooring, if it is for pool flooring or any interior surface where water may be the cause of slips falls, consider a product made by RecDeck www.renosys.com/index.php/renovation-systems/recdeck-pvc-flooring or install concrete.  In Dublin we started out with tile and had numerous slips/falls in our leisure pool.  We then purchased an AquaFlex (PebbleFlex) system that was installed improperly and has failed.   \nRegarding overall design, we toured numerous facilities prior to designing ours and this was extremely useful to both see and hear \"lessons learned\".  You are more than welcome to visit us in Dublin, Ohio.  Another excellent facility to visit is the Recreation Center in Mason, Ohio.    Two quick thoughts on lessons learned - you will always need more space for classes/meetings, fitness equipment, locker rooms and storage, so over design them all for more space than you think you will need.  Also, make sure the site you are building on has room for future expansion.\n\n\nKris, regarding your specific question about flooring, if it is for pool flooring or any interior surface where water may be the cause of slips falls, consider a product made by RecDeck www.renosys.com/index.php/renovation-systems/recdeck-pvc-flooring or install concrete.

  "text": "\n\nWe're in the very early stages of designing a new community recreation facility. I'm seeking \"lessons learned\" from other communities that have done the same. I'm especially interested in safety design/risk management (for example, the design of walking surfaces to reduce the risk of slip and fall accidents, and designing and painting curbs to enhance visibility and reduce the risk of tripping).\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
