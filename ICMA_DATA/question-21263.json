  "text": "\n\nHillsborough County (Florida) and the City of Tampa will be jointly implementing an ERP \u2013 two governments with one solution. On the County side, this project reflects three participating agencies \u2013 the Board of County Commissioners, the Clerk of Circuit Court (the County CFO under Florida law), and a Civil Service Board. Thus, there are four \u201cparticipating agencies\u201d reflected in the contract that will be awarded. \nThe software will be remote hosted by a private data center. An existing interlocal agreement and joint governance structure is being revisited as we prepare for a long term relationship and enter negotiations next month with the selected implementation partner. Alternative models for interlocal agreements and governance structure are sought. Information can be provided directly to Eric Johnson at johnsone@hillsboroughcounty.org \nSuggestions and \u201cwar stories\u201d are appreciated as well.\n\n",
