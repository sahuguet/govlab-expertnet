Cleveland, too, does not issue proclamations for anything of controversy.\nhttp://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/MayorsOffice/Proclamations \nHouston makes it very clear that all proclamations are for very important or significant events, with similar guidelines to the others. \nhttp://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/ceremonialdocs.html\nThe City of Deland, FL has their own guidelines for proclamations as well: they recognize days, weeks, and months worthy of note, in order to generate public awareness.\nhttp://www.deland.org/Pages/DeLandFL_Commission/ProclamationRequest.pdf\nCleveland and Toronto, as you can see from the websites, as well as other cities, follow many of the same guidelines for proclamations. They are usually for special, out of the ordinary events that have no political consequences or insinuations, and no risk of controversy. For something like Emergency Medical Services week, which clearly does not have political or controversial tendencies, that could mean that you may want to issue the proclamation. However, both cities specify that organizations submit requests for proclamations. As a result, what you may want to do if you want to have proclamations issued for these types of events (which do seem incredibly important) is to create committees for them which will have the discretion and responsibility for submitting the proclamation requests. At the same time, what the overwhelming consensus from various proclamations seems to be is that they are recognizing specific individuals or groups that may not get recognition from the city otherwise. So you may want to reserve proclamations to be for people who would not get that recognition without the proclamation.\nYour type of event is not unprecedented as far as being issued proclamations. Here are some examples of proclamations:\nNorth American Occupational Safety and Health Week (http://www.asse.org/newsroom/naosh10/index.php) \nA Season for Nonviolence (http://www.agnt.org/snv2010/proclamations.htm)\nNational Immigrants Day (http://www.immigrantsday.com/home/index.php)\nSexual Assault Awareness Month (http://www.wcasa.org/docs/saam/Requesting%20a%20city%20or%20county%20proclamation.pdf)\nA long list of proclamations from the city of Chubbuck, ID (http://dns.ci.chubbuck.id.us/proclamations.aspx)\nHope that helps!\n\n\nSondra,\nHere are some examples of cities and their policies on proclamations, as well as of some specific proclamations:\nToronto uses proclamations for public awareness campaigns, etc. They do, however, only issue one proclamation per organization per year.
