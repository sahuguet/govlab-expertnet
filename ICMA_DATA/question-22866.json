If you are looking at qualitative/descriptive variables, you could focus on the first part: describing how well your activities support overall community objectives. Summarizing data around program activity (without the formal economic impact), such as citizens/business served, would also be useful.

  "text": "\n\nWe are a quasi-governmental entity created by a Board of County Commissioners comprised of several departments, one of which is a \"community development department.\" We are charged with carrying out an Interlocal Agreement with the Commissioners, which includes managing 7 grant programs, building community partnerships, leveraging public/private investments, among other tasks.  \nOver the last few years, we have had to trim our budgets, among which included a line-item for an economist to perform our annual ROIs. \nFrom the bottom up, how might we perform an ROI at a \"layman's\" level without relying so heavily on \"grant dollars secured\"?  With declining federal, state and local grant and foundation dollars and the increasing competition that accompanies same, we must showcase more than ever before the value of our partnerships, among other hard-to-measure variables.  \nFor those of you measuring ROI of community development, which qualitative variables do you use, how do you measure change and impact?\nAppreciate your kind assistance!  Thank you!\n\n",
