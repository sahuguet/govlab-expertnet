Operational Reserve may only be used to cover unforeseen emergencies and unexpected declines in revenue. To the extent these reserves are expended, the Town will increase its General Fund revenues or decrease its expenditures as necessary to prevent the continued use of these reserves.  Additional funds necessary to restore this Operational Reserve amount will be provided in approximately equal contributions during the 3 fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the drawdown of the reserve occurred.\nOur GF Reserve policy is found at http://www.dhaz.gov/images/stories/pdfs/finance/The%20Appendices.pdf, at page 92; but we are updating this policy in light of GFOA's \"The New Fund Balance\" and GASB No. 54.\n\n\nWe budget a contingency appropriation in the General Fund of at least 5% and no more than 10% of that year\u2019s budgeted expenditures, and an Operational Reserve of at least 30% and no more than 50% of the average actual General Fund revenues for the preceding 5 fiscal years.

We actually try to adhere to that policy for all of our \"operational\" funds (Road Use, Utilities).  The main reason for the policy is to keep the bond rating companies happy since we are a growing community and issue significant amounts of debt on a regular basis.  I have forwarded our budget policy to Lexington.\n\n\nDon, our council has a budget policy that stipulates we keep a minimum cash balance reserve of 20% in the general fund when compared to general fund expenditures.

      "text": "\n\nI consider a 10% reserve a minimum.  In my opinion how much reserve you should maintain depends on the volatility of your revenue sources and the rigidity of your expenses.  The more volatile the sources like sales taxes, and the more rigid your expenses like debt service, the larger the reserve.  In my last city we maintained a 40% reserve because 80% of our revenues were highly volatile.  the level of reserves should not be affected by how flush or poor the budget is, but it may well take years to build an adequate reserve if you are a community of modest budget resources.  Your reserve requirements should be included in your formal financial policies.\n\n\nI consider a 10% reserve a minimum.

Our Budget Director led a cross-departmental workgroup of fiscal officers that conducted a survey of 18 counties and 5 cities in California as part of this effort. Minimum General Fund reserves requirement was increased to 10% of Net Appropriations, plus $2 million for capital projects and $2 million for technology projects. The policy covers appropriate uses of Departmental and Non-Departmental Reserves. When Reserves exceed minimum requirements, allowable uses include cost avoidance and productivity enhancement projects, debt retirement, seed money for pilot programs, and innovation and entrepreneurial fund.

First and foremost we are susceptible to hurricanes, and so our emergency reserve is pretty hefty.
