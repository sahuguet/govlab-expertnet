The program is geared towards adults, not children, but the rewards are based on a point system.  The point breakdown per activity is listed on the web page and I thought you might be able to adapt this program for your purposes.  I hope this helps.

  "text": "\n\nHello,\nI am new to my position as a Program Development Specialist.  Due to my experience as a personal trainer, I have been commissioned the task of creating a Youth Fitness Challenge Program.  I have developed what I consider to be a great six week workout and activity regimen, however, I am having difficulties formatting the program into a challenge format and determing an appropriate point and reward system.  If anyone has any experience with a similar project, please feel free to chime in.\nThanks\nCordell Reynolds\n\n",
