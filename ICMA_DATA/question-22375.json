In addition, the Center for Performance Measurement uses some of this data in its annual survey of local government performance measurement. \nWith regards to IT services, the NES gauges employee satisfaction by asking staff to rate the quality and timeliness of the internal IT services on a four-point scale from excellent to poor. Employees are asked to rate IT services generally and by specific service types (network services, helpdesk services, etc). \nFor more information, visit the NRC website linked above or contact me at (aszumski@icma.org; 202-962-3552).\n\n\nMichael,\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement partners with the National Research Council (www.n-r-c.com) to offer citizen and employee surveys; IT services are one of the internal services covered by the National Employee Survey\u2122.
