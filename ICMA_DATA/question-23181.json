  "text": "\n\nWe have a growing 55+ community that are very active at our programs and in our library.  With the trend of aging in place I am starting to think about and prepare for that community to get older and perhaps less mobile.  What are you doing to continue to serve this community as they are home bound or less mobile?  Do you do home deliveries?  Do you partner with other city departments who are already visiting homes or do the delivery yourself?  Has anyone tried remote locker systems where people can pick up the holds they place at their own community centers?  Are you using volunteers or staff for this?  Thanks for any input or ideas you may have.\n\n",
