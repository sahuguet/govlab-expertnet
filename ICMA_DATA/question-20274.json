Dr. NakaMats described two rooms he used for creativity.  In one, called his \"static room\" it was a place of peace and quiet:  white walls, rock garden, natural running water, plants, and a five-ton boulder from Kyoto.  It was where he did free association.  His \"dynamic room\" was just the opposite:  dark, black and white striped walls, leahter furniture, and special audio and video equipment including heavy duty speakers to blast out instrumental music.  He ended in his swimming pool where he wrote down his ideas.  He did this every day!  It must have worked!\n\n\nIn his 1992 book entitled \"What a Great Idea!\" author and creative guy Chic Thompson included an interview with Dr. Yoshiro NakaMats who at the time held more than 2,300 patents; he invented the floppy disk.

      "text": "\n\nI gave a short talk here at ICMA at our last internal professional development session on problem solving, and creativity spaces was one of the several ideas I discussed for overcoming problems, or initiating innovation. I've attached some of the slides that covered this topic.\nThe first slide (page 2, after the section intro) is just a desert canyon. You can't beat taking a walk in nature to get your creativity moving.  If you don't have a canyon, you probably have a green space or park nearby. Hold a meeting outside for a change (if the weather is nice) and see how that impacts the discussion. The next slide (page 3) juxtaposes a 'creativity room' with a very dry dull cube farm (that many of us live in from 8ish to 5ish). Page 4 is another simple example of a creative space. Page 5 is one of IDEO's work rooms where their designers create new stuff (Tim Brown, their CEO is a keynote speaker at the upcoming conference in San Jose), and the last slide (page 6) shows a multi-purpose room. Basically a nicely appointed kitchen that can double as a 'different' space. Rearrange the tables and chairs, and have a meeting in there.\nWhile I think creativity rooms are a good idea, I think there is more that can be done to inspire workplace creativity. A special room can help, but it's challenging and not necessarily effective to get a bunch of people and say, \"go be creative in that room for 2 hours\".  Especially after they've been dulled by a drab work environment or a particularly boring meeting. \nI think similar or better results can be obtained by exercises designed to get the brain going, and the blood flow.  That's one of the things Wayne's story in this thread is about - Dr. N's swimming pool helped him drive more oxygen to his brain (by swimming), as did the massage chair in his static room (which as I recall he designed to accelerate blood flow to his head).\n\n\nI gave a short talk here at ICMA at our last internal professional development session on problem solving, and creativity spaces was one of the several ideas I discussed for overcoming problems, or initiating innovation.
