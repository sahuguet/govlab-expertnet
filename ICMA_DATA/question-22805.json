As a retired city manager now working for ICMA,  I think you have gotten some great suggestions in response to your question.  \nFrom my experience, an internship or even a job shadowing experience with an experienced finance director/assistant will help to expose you to a comprehensive approach to the way that budgeting is addressed in your community or what ever community you are working in.  I think you will want that \"comprehensive\" knowledge so that you can more fully understand the values and beliefs behind the approach to budgeting and finance.  (you don't want to simply understand accounts payable and receivable, even though that is an important function!)\nLocal  governments take different approaches to planning their financial operation.  Pam Muse suggested the Priority Based Budgeting approach because it is a really great way to link a community's spending to its goals.  You will definitely want to take a look at budgeting over a multi-year period as well as that allows you to have a \"longer view\" in terms of projecting both revenues and expenditures.  Capital expenditure planning is also a large part of any local government's budget, so make sure you understand the importance of longer range approaches through the development of multi-year capital improvement programs.  My last suggestion is to focus on the importance of building fund reserves and to quote our Priority Based Budgeting folks, \"living within your means.\"\nI am attaching a couple of articles that you may wish to explore.   These are two good articles on budgeting from the Center for Priority Based Budgeting which have appeared in ICMA's PM Magazine.  \nYou also may wish to check out the Center for Management Strategies group at  icma.org/cmsgroup  and blog at icma.org/cmsblog on the Knowledge Network as there are a number of postings there that may be of interest in budgeting as well as leading practices on which the ICMA Center for Management Strategies focuses. \nBest of luck in your future career endeavors and be sure to let us know if we can assist you in any way!\nhttp://webapps.icma.org/pm/9509/public/cover.cfm?title=Embracing%20the%20%22Decade%20of%20Local%20Government%22%20%2D%20How%20to%20Face%20Challenges%20and%20Seize%20Opportunities&subtitle=&author=Jon%20Johnson%20and%20Chris%20Fabian%20and%20Cheryl%20Hilvert\nhttp://webapps.icma.org/pm/9408/public/cover.cfm?title=Seeing%20Things%20Differently&subtitle=&author=Jon%20Johnson%20and%20Chris%20Fabian\n\n\nHi Kirk!
