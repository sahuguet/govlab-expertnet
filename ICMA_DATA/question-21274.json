  "text": "\n\nOur community is beginning to research the feasibility of moving towards a fee for service/revenue recovery program for our Rescue Squad/EMS.  We are currently looking to make this transition with the surrounding towns and county at the same time.  What are some good lessons learned and do you have any documentation that was created when your community made this transition?  Did you hire a consultant, learn from other communities, trial and error, or etc.?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nBackground:  We are currently an all-volunteer squad with one paid captain and run approximately 3500 calls/month.  The idea to move towards a fee for service came when considering implementing a partially-paid squad as our volunteer numbers are struggling for our call volume.  While we will be tackling these issues separately, this is how we hope to fund that program.\nThank you in advance.\n\n",
