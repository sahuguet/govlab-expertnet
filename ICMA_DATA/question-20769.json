There are MANY ways we have supported local small business over the years, but here are some that come to mind:\n*We've hosted SBA@the Library events, which feature small business counselors who provide free counseling in our library.  This is a program we've discontinued, but we ran it for 4-5 years.\n*I make appointments with small business library customers who are trying to learn how to use databases to find information, or trying to locate information for their business plan, including how to use the Census for finding demographic information - this could be for start-up or expansion purposes.\n*I create bibliographies of library resources and websites in many areas including Business Plan, Money for Small Business, Marketing, International Business, etc.  We also have presented a program called \"Jumpstart Your Business\" where we feature many agencies that support small business - a way to introduce our library customers to those in the community who can provide support.\n*I maintain a list of up-to-date business websites with annotations on our website to point folks to the info they need.\n*I train fellow Librarians and Library Assistants so that they're acquainted with the kinds of resources and questions those in our local business community may ask and how to provide appropriate service.\n*I network and speak at groups about the library as a business resource so that awareness is built among small business service providers and clients.\nIf anyone has any questions, please contact me directly.\nSincerely,\nSandy Rizzo\nRed Mountain Branch of Mesa Public Library, Mesa AZ\n\n\nI'm business librarian at Mesa Public Library in Mesa, AZ.
