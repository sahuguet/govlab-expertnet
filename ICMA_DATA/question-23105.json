  "text": "\n\nThe City of West St. Paul, MN is looking to hire a consultant through a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process to develop several commercial overlay districts specifically addressing design standards.  If you have an example of a recent RFQ or RFP for something similar, it would be extremely helpful if you can share it.  We are looking at possibly advertising it nationally rather than just local.\nWest St. Paul is a first tier suburb of Mpls/St. Paul with a 2.5 mile commercial corridor with three different types of commercial development (result of hsitorical development patterns).  The goal is to create three overlay districts with specific design standards based on the different characteristics of each area.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks,\nBen Boike\nCity Planner\nWest St. Paul, MN\n651-552-4134\n\n",
