As someone who looks at things differently, and as someone who is usually the questioner, I love the suggestion of staff taking turns asking those tough questions. Sometimes we become so polite that we don't ask those tough and probing questions that help bring us to a more balanced outcome.\n\n\nGreat suggestions.

Use a more formal brainstorm process of \"pro\" and \"con\" where you list both sides. Use a force-field analysis -- another form of brainstorming -- where you list the forces moving you towards a goal and those that move you away from it. As a group construct a process decision pathway chart -- listing all the possible outcomes at each step and take them all to their conclusion. It is a variation on a tree diagram that lists all the things that could go wrong and makes you work through each -- a way of doing contingency planning or unearthing all the possible outcomes from a series of decisions.\nAssign someone to be the \"skunk at the party\" who will question all conclusions by asking a series of \"Why?\" questions - making people articulate the underpinnings to their conclusions. Rotate that role until it becomes a more natural way for the group to explore options and the reasons for moving down one path or another. \nLiterally move people around the room/table and ask them to consciously take on another perspective or point of view for a set period of time in carrying out the group's discussion or evaluation. This helps a person to assume a role of advocating/exploring another point of view or facet of any decision.\nIf the group has reached a decision without a lot of conversation, ask the entire group to spend the next 15 minutes \"punching holes in our argument\" to see if they have missed something. \nIf it is a team of leaders or decision-makers its not about moving to a \"debate\" format, its about adopting a desire for inquiry about the subject matter at hand and wanting to explore all the different points of view and arguments around the decision -- to improve the quality of the decision. You want to make everyone a bit skeptical about quick and \"consensus\" decisions. Remember the Abilene Paradox about what you think may be consensus, but has a lot of unvoiced concerns or disagreements.\n\n\nAsk people to take \"the other side\" -- not their own, but an opposition side -- and make their argument.

A more nuanced way would be to encourage team members to challenge a concept or proposal during a regular meeting, and invite or lead the counter-argument.  So team members don't feel turf challenges or that their area of responsibility is under attack you could ask them to take the opposite position at the next meeting or even at the next discussion break.\nA less academic approach would be to facilitate a style that encourages breaking down ideas/concepts with a plus/change iterative approach. What do we like about this idea? What would we change about this idea? In \"Good to Great\",  Jim Collins talked about how some of the successful companies had passionate (but professional) arguments about ideas at their executive meetings.\nIn his Leading Ideas interview with Bob O'Neill, Frans Johansson talked about reversing assumptions--which could be yet another way to promote friendly debate over an issue. You can watch that interview at http://icma.org/leadingideas.\n\n\nOne idea could be to assign team members to take responsibility/defense for one side of an issue (like a competitive debate format).

It sounds like you already understand the value of dissenting perspectives, so I'm providing some material that could back you up: Patrick Lencioni's \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" (one of which is a fear of conflict), and an exhaustive 2009 article called \"In Praise of Dissent\" (attached and complete w/ my highlights of key thoughts).   I found both of them to be inspiring and helpful in different ways; I hope you do as well.\n\n\nI second all the great recommendations.
