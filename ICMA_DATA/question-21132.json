The proposal outlined the current situation, discussed the need for changes, outlined the recommended solutions, and discussed the benefits of the recommended solution. This was presented to the County Manager, who in turn presented to the Board of County Commissioners, where it was accepted. With the Board behind the proposal, we were able to use that for generating support and participation. Not exactly what you are trying to achieve, I suppose. For your situation, perhaps what would appear to be more \"agreeable\" would be, rather than a contract, a proposal or Project Charter that not only describes the above content, but then also outlines the roles and responsibilities of the initiative team, and the roles and responsibilities of management (required for a successful implementation), and then obtain signatures from the appropriate individuals. Sorry, I don't have an example to share, just thoughts...\n\n\nI did something similar here in Douglas County, NV. However, it was not a contract but a formal proposal.

I'm currently responsible for organization-wide performance management in my county and led the establishment of this function from scratch (a permanent division supplemented by a cross-departmental team). As such, I have a few clarifying questions: Was this effort initiated within the department, by the City Manager, or from some other source? How much understanding and support of performance management exists within the department and in the larger organization? Will your efforts be confined to your department, or will they affect other parts of the organization?\nDepending on your responses, I agree w/ Lynn McKissock that establishing a charter may be the best way to go. You can define the purpose, outputs and outcomes, duration, authority, and other expectations of the initiative team along with clarifying the role of the City Manager (and other contributors) in supporting the initiative.\nI'm attaching a sample charter I've used, but after laying the groundwork the success of your effort really depends on two things (in my opinion): managing relationships and ensuring that the work you're doing gets incorporated into the day-to-day operations. That means getting and maintaining buy-in from stakeholders/users through ongoing communication, managing expectations, clarifying priorities, etc. Also, if this initiative doesn't become part of the day-to-day, it will surely become another task that people do after all the \"important\" stuff is done and won't command the attention it deserves.\nI can offer more specific guidance if you like, depending on your answers to my earlier questions. All the best in your endeavor.\n\n\nDaniel, what you are embarking on is a challenging but worthwhile task.

  "text": "\n\nI am currently working as part of an initiative developing a department-wide performance management and measurement system for a municipal government.   I am trying to secure managerial support for this program and am in the process of drafting a contract of sorts ensuring mutual support between the initiative team and the city manager.  Does anyone have experience with such a situation and, if so, in what language did you couch your proposition and what terms did you establish for the agreement? Could you upload an example? Thank you for your help.\n\n",
