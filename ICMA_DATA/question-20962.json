If not you can contact them and they will be happy to forward it to you.  It defines the relationship between staff and council and  council and staff, the protocol between Council members and their procedures for conducting business and meetings.  I have implemented these in each city I served for over 20 years.  It is a great tool to end the arguments about what proper procedure is or the accusation that you would do it for so and so but not for me.  Because it is adopted by Resolution it also gives the staff the legal duty to say I don't have the authority to violate the Council Policy unless we place the matter on the Agenda and then the Council can direct.  It also gets staff out of the middle of a lot of infighting or helps councilpersons out of a pickle if a strong supporter is pressuring the councilperson to run interference for them at the city.\n\n\nI developed a City Council Policy Manual adopted by Resolution when I was with the City of Beverly Hills.
