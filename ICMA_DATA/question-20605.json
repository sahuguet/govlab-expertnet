There is pretty compelling evidence that the addition of meters where parking demand is high actually improves business revenues.  A number of parking consultants could help with this as well.  Lynchburg has had similar concerns and is planning on adding pay stations in the central business district.\n\n\nI encourage you to read \"The High Cost of Free Parking\" by Donald Shoup to understand how removing the meters could be counter productive to your goal of providing turnover and preventing employees from parking in front of businesses.

      "text": "\n\nDouglas,\nIf you're looking to remove parking meters, it's going to be difficult to encourage meaningful turnover of those parking spots. If people see spots that are open and have no time limit, they will take advantage of them, for hours if not days at a time. \nArlington, Virginia has an interesting system. Parking during the workday is meter-based, but after 4:30 pm all spaces become available free of charge. This is an excellent balance because it ensures that drivers aren't hogging spots for long periods of time during peak hours while allowing for longer periods of parking during off-hours. \nThere are also a glut of parking garages that were built to ensure that if you absolutely need it, parking will be available (at a steeper price of course, but it's still there).\nI regularly park my car in Arlington during peak and off-peak hours and despite the fact that it's a densely populated city, I rarely run into trouble finding parking when I need it. \nhttp://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/EnvironmentalServices/dot/traffic/parking/EnvironmentalServicesParking.aspx\nTake a look at the \"Meters and Other Payment Devices to Encourage Turnover\" section. It provides deeper explanations of the system I've just described to you.\nGood luck!\nDerek Johnson\n\n\nDouglas,\n\nIf you're looking to remove parking meters, it's going to be difficult to encourage meaningful turnover of those parking spots.

      "text": "\n\nSome meter brands accept 'debit' cards that can be nothing more than encoded coupons that merchants give to customers for 'free parking' or reducted rate parking. That may help build customer loyalty and repeat business as well as solve the problem of employee parking in prime spots. While you may not be able to eliminate all meters, you can reduce the number and drive operating costs down. An alternate solution for fewer meters is to go to pay-by-cell service, such as Verrus, which easily handles variable rate service and opens opportunities to work out parking 'deals' with merchants.  It can also reduce the number of meters and operating costs. \nGood luck! \n  Darlene Pfeiffer, MPA, CPPT, CAPP \nCity of Fort Lauderdale Parking Services\nFinancial Administrator\ndpfeiffer@fortlauderdale.gov\n\n\nSome meter brands accept 'debit' cards that can be nothing more than encoded coupons that merchants give to customers for 'free parking' or reducted rate parking.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Painesville has parking meters in our central business district and we are looking for an innovative solution to remove them while providing assistance to the merchants. The merchants have two concerns: 1) their clients are getting parking tickets, and 2) if the meters are eliminated, they are concerned about people parking all day in the spots in front of their businesses. We are looking for an innovative way to solve this parking issue. Right now we provide 20 minutes free, with 1 hour limit. We have to provide a time limit due to the fact that Painesville is the County seat and their employees (County Administration or Job and Family Services) or their clients take the spots meant for retail customers.  \nIf you have any recommendations on ways to resolve, please contact me. Thank you!  \nSincerely,\nDouglas L.
