      "text": "\n\nHi Christopher,\nMost of the policies I've read specify that all costs associated with a donation/memorial request be covered by the person or persons applying for it. In very few cases, the city was willing to pick up part of the maintenance, but never more than 10-15% of the overall cost.\nSince the city paid for 65% of it, I think your situation is a little grayer. I suppose it depends largely on what effect you think denying the plaque would have on future citizen/city funded projects. If it presents an \"all cost or no credit\" choice to residents interested in helping out, it may discourage donations in the future, and that's worth considering. Perhaps there is a middle ground that can be found, whereby citizens contributing funds could be recognized, either on the memorial or through some fashion other than a plaque, if city leaders believe that honor ought to be reserved for privately subsidized memorials and donations?\nAttached is the public art, monument and memorial policy for the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas. I chose this one because it is very representative of the view that most cities have when it comes to responsibility for funding/maintenance of a donated memorial monument. Hope this helps. Good luck.\nDerek Johnson\n\n\nHi Christopher,\n\nMost of the policies I've read specify that all costs associated with a donation/memorial request be covered by the person or persons applying for it.

  "text": "\n\nLast night I proposed to the Council to purchase a bronze statue for a park using 65% city funding and 35% funding from memorial funds donated to the city for a deceased resident.  The statue would have a plaque reading \"In Memory of (name)\"  Members debated whether it was appropriate to allow the plaque since a majority of the funding was from the city.  I suggested that such a practice would allow us to stretch our projects budget further.  Do you have a policy that would address this issue?\nThank you for your assistance.\n\n",
