If the ICMA member submitted it to the city attorney who came back saying it was OK, then it's not a violation. The personal due diligence followed by the ICMA member will determine whether this was a violation, and that requires an investigation, a hearing, and a deliberative body acting in a judicious manner to make the final determination.\n\n\nWithout knowing more facts, I have to say \"maybe\".

It is not a violation of the ICMA Code of Ethics to know of or suspect a violation and do nothing. Discussing the situation in this forum is not the same as filing a complaint and staff will not initiate a case on their own.  I find that troubling, but apparently enough members do not.\n\n\nRegardless of what anyone thinks about a member's actions, ICMA will not take any action unless a complaint, even an anonymous one, is submitted.

When you go into an X-Session, it's not always possible to predict what will take place & one of your roles should be to advise elected officials when they may be in violation of state laws.  In most states, govt has a right to protect certain business plans. If this wasn't the case it would put a damper on economy development.  At times, the error occurs in not bringing X-Session decisions & discussions to an open session for ratification.

Beyond the question of ethics and proper conduct is the even more important question of the role of the City Manager in this case which is clearly not to usurp the role of the City Attorney and it is the City Attorney who should be the one expected to weigh in on whether a meeting needs to open or not.  If the City Attorney opines a meeting should be open and the elected body stills meets in closed session with the City Manager present, or if it could be proven the City Manager wilfully caused the City Attorney to not be sought for an opinion to allow the closed meeting to occur then a case could be made for an ethics violation.  But, in either of those two situations, there would be many grey areas.\n\n\nHaving served in an executive position in a Florida city, I have served under one of the most stringent and complicated set of laws governing open meetings.
