  "text": "\n\nBecause most research on political involved large cities, very little is known about the nature, extent, and impact of patronage in small town America.  Researchers at Texas Tech University Department of Public Administration are interested in learning about the nature of patronage in small towns across America, as well as understanding the impact of the various forms of patronage on the job performance of city administrators.\nIf you are a city administrator in a small town (population less than 20,000), we are very much interested in your perspective on political patronage in small town America.  The survey is a simple multiple-choice instrument that should take about five minutes to complete.  Participation is strictly voluntary and your responses will be kept in strict confidence.  Because the results of the survey will be aggregated, your responses are not individually identifiable in any way.  Your anonymity and privacy will be protected.\nThe survey can be accessed via the following link.  Additional instructions will be provided there.\nSurvey Link \uf0e8  http://tltc.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_1ZhGcVtqFAvRURS\nDeadline for participation is January 25, 2012.\nWe are happy to answer any questions you might have.  We may be reached at:\nDwight Gard, Ph.D.       email address:  dwight.gard@ttu.edu\nDavid Hamilton, Ph.D.  email address:  david.hamilton@ttu.edu\nThank you very much for your cooperation.  We look forward to hearing your perspective.\n\n",
