Due to budget and millage constraints, Ann Arbor is considering privatizing trash collection services.  Can you provide examples of cities that have privatized in the last 5 years or so by signing a contract with a single service provider? \nWe are investigating: \n- Estimated financial savings \n- Contract stipulations to manage customer service\n- What happens to city assets \nPlease provide city names, information, or contacts.
