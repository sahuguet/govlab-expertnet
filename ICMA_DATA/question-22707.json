  "text": "\n\nThe Las Vegas City Council just approved an agreement with Discovery Studios, LLC, to produce a reality based television show featuring the City. With that as background you can imagine there are a lot of questions from both appointive and classified staff concerning what is appropriate behavior and what is not. That said, I am in the process of writing a city wide policy and procedure that will address many of the questions and rather than re-inventing the wheel I am hopeful that ICMA through its database and connetions with other cities will be able provide copies of policies and procedures that I would be able to review and use as a guideline to write policies and procedures for our city. I am on a short timeframe so the sooner I get the informationl or any guidance would be appreciated.\nThanks\n\n",
