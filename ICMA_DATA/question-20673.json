      "text": "\n\nI do not have a contract. But some good overall measures of health of a local government (which could possibly be considered when asking the question of how well the leader is doing) are: (1) Ratio of employees to residents. (2) Average cost per citizen (i.e. Total budget divided by # of residents). These measures are especially useful when you benchmark them against similar municipalities, alone they don't tell you much. In addition, you might also want to have a 360 degree evaluation of yourself based on Kouzes' and Posner's research. A link I found (and I'm sure there are more) is www.lpionline.com. Positive increases in this assessment from time to time could also be an indicator of improvement. I would also suggest The Leadership Challenge (by the same authors).

  "text": "\n\nMy Town Council is a group of professionals who all basically receive their personal pay through incentives/bonuses.  Five of the seven are commission based.   They are committed to managing the future growth of my pay through a similar system, either as the primary way for it to grow or as a supplemental way to \u201creward\u201d performance.  \nThis past Tuesday night they asked me to get them some examples and ideas of measurable goals and objectives that they could use to help them make a determination on when and how much of an incentive/bonus I should receive.   I am requesting any guidance, specific examples of how any of you may have something set up, if you have had experience in this type of situation, what worked, what did not work, if you have specific language in your contract that addresses this type of issue, that would be helpful as well.\nThank you for your time.\nMike Land, Town Manager\nAdministration\nTown of Prosper\nwww.prospertx.gov\nmike_land@prospert.gov\n972.346.2640 (o)\n972.346.9335 (f)\n\n",
