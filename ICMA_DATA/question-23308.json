I also run the reporting mechanism, website and will soon start receiving quarterly updates.  On top of that have to build a budget soon.  We have teams of other staff members working on various tasks, such as employee engagement.  But they have other jobs to do as well.  So not a single dedicated FTE to our process either.  Am interested to read what others have to say.\n\n\nHi Matt.   We are in the same boat as you guys as you are aware.

I have responsibility for administering the plan which includes plan development, adoption, and reporting.  My position is Senior Operations/Management Analyst and I report to the assistant city manager.  I would estimate that the strat plan takes up about 1/3 of my time on an ongoing basis which would also include doing some training with our departments.  Our City Manager took the lead role in our most recent 5-year plan development and the departments then were responsible for translating the goals down to objectives, projects, and tasks which could be assigned to sections/teams/staff.  Several of our departments have management analysts and they assist their departments in developing/reporting on strat plan goals, other department have assigned key staff to this role.  We (CM, ACM, myself, budget director) hold quarterly budget and strat plan reviews with all departments reporting on progress, and I also publish a quarterly report to the CM and Council which gets distributed externally.  When the CM has his quarterly meeting with all city staff he will typically talk about strat plan issues and identify them as such.  I also work with our Public Information Office to publish a public report after each 5-year strat plan cycle.  I would say that today there is a high level of awareness of the strat plan and engagement with the process compared to 4 years ago when I first started and this primarily has to do with the CM leadership and involvement.\n\n\nOur city has a population of 100,000 and while we do not have a single position dedicated to strategic planning there are numerous people involved at different levels of the organization.

I think the ideal is to get everyone involved so that it's not a distinct set of tasks to be done but interwoven into the tasks we're already doing. Evaluation should be constant and automatic. At that point the dedicated staff time should remain relatively small but very effective most of the year.\n\n\nI'd say maybe 0.3 FTE here. It's not ideal but it's a step in the right direction.

The department's name has since changed and Bob Goehrig, the current department director, can answer questions about it today (rgoehrig@coralsprings.org ). In addition to budget and CIP, the office was responsible for performance management and staffing process improvement teams. One FTE was a performance measurement analyst and all of the senior budget analysts got involved in strategic planning and performance management for their assigned departments. In all, the department had 5.5 FTEs when I was there and about 25% of our time was spent on developing and implementing the strategic plan and business plan.\n\n\nWhen I worked for the City of Coral Springs (pop. 126,000), my title was \"Budget & Strategic Planning Manager,\" because it was acknowledged that resource allocation was a function, or outcome, of the strategic planning process.

One staffer in the executive's office has responsibility for strategic planning plus organizational development. The budget office runs a performance website, with staff support from a management fellow (me). Department staff report on their indicators quarterly. This is not the ideal level of staffing.\n\n",
