  "text": "\n\nThe City of Sunnyvale, CA is gearing up for a parade celebrating their centennial.  They are interested in costing information that you might be able to provide re: the parade(s) you\u2019ve coordinated in you agency.  Obviously there are many contingencies, such as police overtime rates, size of parade etc., but, whatever data you might have that says for example, \u201cour city sponsored a one mile parade and it cost approximately $__\u201d, would be hugely helpful.  Or, if you could provide a \"guesstimate\" of staff hours devoted to planning and conducting the parade would be useful too.\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
