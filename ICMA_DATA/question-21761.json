Before this came about, the Fire Department responded a rescue unit for a Volunteer Rescue Squad also in this county.  It lasted for quite some time until we took over doing all rescue calls inside the city limits.  I wasn't able find any agreements on this.  Lastly, we did have one that our city Risk Management Office and Insurance Company did stop.  We would drive ambulances from medical calls when it would require more than one EMS worker to help with the patient.  They considered it a liability since we were never trained to drive that type vehicle.  We now ride in with the patient while the other EMS worker drives.  Hope this helps.\n\n\nChief Whitaker, hope all is well.  I have attached a copy of an agreement that we have with the county that we are in.

A visionary approach to sharing fire and emergency response vehicles is to create a special district or joint emergency management department with an appointed chief that reports to and represents the two or more communities that could join.  Transfer and assign staffing and operational and replacement responsibilities for vehicles/equipment to this district/department to maintain and mobilize efficiently based on industry leading fire and safety practices.  This allows a number of benefits:\n1)  Consolidate staffing, paid and volunteers, to have responsibility for a larger area of coverage.  All hires should meet common set of performance and capability guidelines.\n2)  Evaluate appropriate locations and layout of stations to assure optimum distance for meeting 4 minute response rule and eliminate excessive coverage zones based on GIS mapping assessment.\n3)  Evaluate service calls to locate specialty fire and emergency equipment in zones where frequency of need can be justified.\n4)  Share the cost of training and expand mentoring strategies for new or novice staff.\n5)  Consolidate information technology requirements that centralize information to one location that provides access to all distributed station sites.\n6)  Share the cost of mobile technology needs.\n7)  Centralize 911 response capabilities to one location.\n8)  Consider improving cross connection of water systems between communities to improve pressure zones for fire supply needs.\n9)  Establish standard hydrant style or type to improve training, operation and repair requirements\n10) Split the cost of budgeting for this joint/consolidated service district/department equally with the contractual understanding that abuse of equipment, excess use of certain specified materials, or requests by property owners (i.e., business owners, manufacturers, and so on) will require monetary compensation to offset those excess costs.\n11) Eliminate excessive duplicate vehicles and equipment where appropriate.\n12) Establish or share centralized purchasing and storeroom for controlling and monitoring parts and supply acquisition and distribution.\nThis is not a comprehensive list of benefits but the issue is taking advantage of economies of scale where those services are most appropriate.\n\n\nThis response doesn't directly apply to the original question but I thought I'd add it to the discussion.
