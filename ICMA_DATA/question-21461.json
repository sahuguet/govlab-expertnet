  "text": "\n\nFederal transportation policy directs the flow of billions of dollars to state and local governments - money which supports the transportation networks that are vitally important to regional economic development. \nSenate transportation leaders have announced that they will move forward with committee action on a two-year transportation authorization bill. The bill is known as the \"Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) and will be considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The bill maintains highway spending programs for two years but reduces funding for Amtrak and high speed rail service.\nhttp://www.ampo.org/assets/library/280_map21outline.pdf \nWhile the House continues to push for longer transportation authorization funding, the 2012 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development bill released by the Appropriations Committee reduces highway and transit spending to bring costs more in line with fuel tax revenues. Other cuts include Amtrak funding for states and TIGER grants for regional and local transportation projects.\nAs Congress moves forward what are the most important transportation funding items you would like to see preserved?\n\n",
