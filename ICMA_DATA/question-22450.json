If its a policy its an expectation for a behavior, such as tardiness.  The HOW, if you will, of the way the business is run (think of an attendance policy) and the procedure would be the WHAT.  So for an attendance policy the expectation is that you are here x% of time and when you aren't then the impact is Z...the what would be that if you cannot be here you have to call and inform someone and fill out an absence sheet when you return indicating the time you are taking in-lieu of your scheduled hours.  Each function is a BP (policy) and the way its done is the SOP (procedure).\n\n\nI am in the process of starting the new centralized call center for Hillsborough County and I am writing BPs (business policies) and SOP (standard operating procedures)...the primary thing to understand and develop in a logic tree when attempting to separate these items for me is what does the defined policy or procedure DO?
