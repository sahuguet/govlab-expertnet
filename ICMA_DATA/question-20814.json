Moreover it's difficult to predict how the current government would respond to a shutdown, because each federal agency is responsible for crafting and updating its own \"shutdown plan.\u201d Without delving too deeply into the complexities of the federal budgetary process, the devolution of Federal programs on to state and local proxies, or the continuing trend of contracting and privatization, it falls on us then to examine the impact of the five-day federal government shutdown of November 1995 and the twenty-one-day federal government shutdown, ending in January 1996. \nThe federal fiscal year ended on September 30, 1995. In most years lawmakers passed twelve appropriation bills for the president's approval. Those bills gave federal agencies the legal authority to spend and conduct business. As a resulted of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives\u2019 failure to pass and President Clinton\u2019s failure to sign the FY 1996 federal budget however, Congress was forced to pass a continuing resolution on October 1 to authorize continued funding for departments until new budgets could be approved. This afforded the federal government approximately two weeks to choose between compromise and a shutdown of the federal government. \nWhat followed was an elaborate game of chicken between then President Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Because the President refused to make the budget cuts Republicans demanded, Speaker Gingrich threatened to refuse to raise the debt limit, allowing the country to default instead. Both sides refused to budge and thus on November 14, 1995 the federal government discontinued non-essential services. The standoff lasted until November 19. The Clinton administration released documentation of the costs of the shutdown. The shutdown was resolved with the passage of a temporary spending bill, but underlying disagreements between Gingrich and Clinton were not resolved, resulting in a second shutdown that lasted from December 16, 1995 to January 6, 1996.\nThe most immediate impacts of the federal government shutdowns were that hundreds of thousands of federal employees and government contractors were furloughed. While Federal employees eventually received back pay, contractors didn't get so lucky. Lost wages equals less taxable income, not only on the federal level but on the state and local levels as well. Lost income tax revenue aside, the shutdown proved an inconvenience to citizens, including delays in social security, Medicare, and FHA mortgage loans.

  "text": "\n\nToday we received this question from a Governing magazine reporter:\n\"I\u2019m writing an article about the impact a federal government shutdown could have on state and local governments, since it\u2019s looking more and more like that\u2019s a real possibility. Could you put feelers out in your organization and see if anyone has thoughts? It sounds like it will impact states more than local governments, but I figured I\u2019d ask.\"\nAny thoughts?\n\n",
