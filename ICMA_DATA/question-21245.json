How many of your services are contracted out?  How many square miles in the city and what type of infrastructure is in place?  Depending on their background and experience, a city manager can also serve as the CFO, city planner, public works director,  public safety chief, etc. particularly if these are contracted services with the county or a private provider.  You might be able to contract with a retired city manager to serve part time say two days a week to advice the city council and oversee staff and contractors.  City's have very complex legal obligations and standards of operation and are different then running a private company.  Some level of professional management is highly desirable.  An experienced city manager can prevent large costs related to inexperienced decisions and avoiding legal liabilities.\n\n\nI have served in a very small city and understand the concerns of the budget and size of operation.

It was a revelation to me, since I had inadequate revenue and a small, but excellent staff. A professional Manager was needed and after I retired the  City hired a young professional on a full time basis. I had a number of Assistants in the larger cities and believe the ones who started in small cities made the best Assistants and later full time Managers. I am now a Range Rider and we help a numbero of small cities with recruitment. I just assisted a city of 1,400 find a Manager. The city is expecting growth and is a full service city.\n\n\nI spent 30 years in middle size to larger cities and after retirement took a 20 hour per week job in a nearby city of 1,500.

In small cities one employee does quite a lot. I had an MPA student sometime that was  the budget and fiscal manager as well as the the HR director. They had one full-time Sheriff, and a few part-timers on the city law enforcement staff. Lots of environmental factors determine viable options. Crime rate of the city will also affect the decision for the size of full-time Sheriff staff, etc. I taught in MPA programs for several years. There is no straight jacket answer to this question; more information is needed or a study would be an option.\n\n\nIt depends on several factors, such as the expertise of the Mayor; the size of the city; the level of diverse experience of the current directors on the payroll and their respective ability to combine offices.

I too think the answer is different for every community and is dependent upon several factors including: the educational and professional experience of your council, the mayor's availability and willingness to manage daily municipal operations, how much debt your city has and the scope of ongoing projects. If your constituents expect a high level of professionalism and immediacy of response from their local government, I believe you would be well served by a professional manager. In 2006 my city's council made a conscious decision to hire a professional manager and adopt related ordinances giving that person authority to oversee personnel, budget, etc, in part because they wanted to have the most professional image possible, and in part because they are all full-time professionals themselves and don't have time to devote to running daily operations at the City.\n\n\nI am the manager in a city of only 1,900 with a budget about half that of the city you represent.

However, with that having been said....revenues are continually decreasing leaving much less work for a full time manager, as well as funding, so needless to say I am looking for another position as my moral compass is having difficulties justifying the 40 hour work week (in about two months, I will have about 20 hours of work a week to do).  I have discussed this situation with our auditor (who is in agreement with me) as well as one of my council members and hopefully will find something in the near future (still have a year and a half left on my contract).  What I will be proposing once I tender my resignation is that they do a job share (inter-governmental agreement).  Another community not to far away has a part-time manager and he would be willing to do part-time here as well so it would be a win-win for both jurisdictions as they could split costs on salary and benefits and still have the rewards of a professional manager overseeing the administrative components necessary of the organizations.  Part of the problem here (as you indicated in your post) was the previous manager had no real manager experience in the sense of a professional degree (he had been an elected supervisor in a neighboring township) so unfortunately some things happened financially that we are now having to deal with that have set us back significantly.  I think that regardless of the size, if you can employee a professional manager, you should, it does benefit the organization significantly.   Additionally, the code of ordinances here calls for a manager to oversee the administrative operations.  So to change how things are done is easier as its an amendment to the code of ordinances (council action) rather than changing the charter (vote of people).\n\n\nI currently am working in a community of 1774, same size budget  and we are a full service community and I am a full time manager.

My title is Assistant to the Manager, but I handle all of the human resource functions and accounts payable. I also assist the Finance Director, all in addition to my duties assisting the Manager. We have a population of 2400 and a budget around $4 million. We have a very progressive Village Manager as well as a progressive Council.  We have a small system of local government but we are able to make it work very well. Most managers are well versed in the wearing of multiple hats.

My background is financial management and my beliefs are having someone running a \"business\" with $4mil in receipts on a popularity contest is crazy. But just this statement isn't enough, I was wondering if you have information/statistics on the size of city that a city Manager makes sense.\n\n",
