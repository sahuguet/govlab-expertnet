If you are interested in contacting the representative, her name is Linda Hoffman and her email address is lhoffmann@larimer.org.

      "text": "\n\nHi Pamela,\nSorry for the delay, but I'm glad Amanda ran across our system.  I think we do have a good online special events system that works well.  Our permit system is all online and self service and allows us to route event applications to numerous partner entities to comment and approve the events.  Each set is unique depending on the event.  Some, such as major bike races, may touch many jurisidictions.  Some may only require internal review, such as events at one of our parks.  The system seems to work for a variety of affected agencies from small rural volunteer EMS/fire services, to Colorado Dept. of Transportation.  The system also provides a subscription service for citizens to subscribe to notifications to events proposed in their neighborhood, based on zip code.  Citizens can also comment on events during the planning process.    We have worked with two cities in our county and now host mirror systems for their special events that don't require county permits.  Hopefully this consistency makes it easier for event promoters and citizens alike to apply for permits and to make sure all the bases are covered for major special events throughout the county.   I would probably be the best contact for more information, rather than our planning department.   They system covers some events that are covered by our land use code, but also events at county parks and open lands, and events using county roads.\nFrank Lancaster\nLarimer County Manager\n\n\nHi Pamela,\nSorry for the delay, but I'm glad Amanda ran across our system.
