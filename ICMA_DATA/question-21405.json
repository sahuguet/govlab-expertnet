Here are a few samples of various municipalities and their approach to this issue....\nStearns County, MO\n\uf0a7   There are 965 centerline miles of County roads that the Highway Department is responsible to maintain. \n\uf0a7   Approximately 50 miles are gravel roads. \n\uf0a7   85 lane miles are maintained by municipalities under Municipal Maintenance Agreements. \nSnowplow Drivers/Routes \n\uf0a7   There are approximately 24 plow routes\n\uf0a7   The Highway Department has 26 dedicated plow trucks. The two oldest units are kept as spares in case of mechanical breakdown. \n\uf0a7   The expected life of a plow truck is about 13 years. Since there are 26 trucks, this requires the purchase of two trucks per year on average at a cost of about $160,000 each. \nMinnesota\n\uf0a7   There are 135,000 miles of streets and highways in Minnesota including 12,000 miles of state highways. All state highways are two or more lanes wide, MnDOT is responsible for approximately 31,000 lane miles of roadway in the state, 5,000 of which are in the Twin Cities Metro Area. (A lane mile is one mile of a single roadway lane. Therefore, one mile of a four-lane roadway equals four lane miles.)\n\uf0a7   MnDOT has approximately 1,482 priority 1 snowplow drivers and 300 priority 2 (backup) drivers. \nOlathe, KS\n\uf0a7   The Olathe Public Works Department is responsible for snow removal on 1,237 lane miles of roadway and 1461 cul-de-sacs.\n\uf0a7   Olathe works to keep 60 vehicles removing snow during the day shift and 44 operating during the nightshift. They work 12-hours shifts throughout a winter storm in order to provide 24 hour winter coverage.\nColumbus, OH\n\u2022   112 Equipment Operators (plus 35 cross-trained)\n\uf0a7   Columbus\u2019 Snow Warriors are responsible for more than 6,300 lane miles of roadway, more than any other Ohio city (or, 2,053 linear miles, approximately the distance between Columbus and Las Vegas) \n\uf0a7   Beginning with the 2010-11 winter season, the City of Columbus is a member of an Ohio Department of Transportation-led consortium of the state and Ohio municipalities, counties, townships and villages\nMontgomery County, MD\n\uf0a7   When it snows, 200 employees with 175 pieces of equipment spring into action. \n\uf0a7   There are more than 5,000 lane miles of roads that Montgomery County Department of Transportation crews clear. including more than 4,000 lane miles of neighborhood roads and nearly 1,000 lane miles of emergency routes, primary roads (arterial roads connecting subdivisions or business districts) and secondary roads (main collector streets through subdivisions).\nI hope its helpful!\n\n\nHi Greg,\nThanks for your question.
