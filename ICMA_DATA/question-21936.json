Professional planners sometimes have sometimes felt surprised and at a loss for how best to respond to heated criticism from this unexpected quarter. Last year I helped present a draft comprehensive plan for a small city to a local Tea Party meeting, happy to address a group of engaged citizens but surprised at the depth of skepticism. What is a planner to do when confronted by citizens deeply suspicious of planning as a profession? You can find planners' discussions around this topic here on ICMA and in planning journals.\n\n\nYou might also examine engagement against planning.\n\nSome Tea Party and affiliated local activists have spoken out against comprehensive plans and community planning projects, observing a connection to the United Nations Agenda 21 agreement and the erosion of citizens' civil liberties, including property rights.

A grant requirement is that the city do an annual plan identifying deployment of funds to be received and generally such an annual plan takes the form of a community planning document.  There is also a requirement for community input and outreach which some cities embrace aggressively and some cities follow the strict \"letter of what is required\".  As a starting point, you can go to the HUD website and find a list of the cities which are entitlement grant recipients.  Plans are required to be available to the public and many cities do make it available on their web sites.\n\n\nIn terms of research, a good starting point on community planning tied to civic engagement would be to look at what are known as \"entitlement cities\" which are cities which annual are direct recipients of Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
