While performance measurement sounds like a purely quantitative exercise, there is a significant qualitative aspect as well.  Who are you selecting as a comparable community or activity?  What aspects of performance are you measuring:  outputs or outcomes?  The more you move toward the latter, the more art than science it becomes.\n\n\nI am not sure what you mean by \"that it can be recreated if needed in the future.\"  If your question arises from a lack of confidence in current data then conducting an audit of the data sources, benchmark sources, and the methodology would be an approach to consider.

Performance data, like any other type of enterprise data, should have certain data quality standards, as data quality does not happen by accident. \nOrganizations must establish standards and guidelines for all personnel to follow to ensure that data quality is addressed during the entire lifecycle. For example, standards should be established for defining the data, naming the data, establishing domains and business rules, and modeling the data. \nGuidelines should be in place for data entry, edit checking, validating and auditing of data, correcting data errors, and removing the root causes of data contamination. Training and familiarization with the standards and guidelines should be required of all data entry staff, data stewards, and information consumers. Standards and guidelines should also include policies and procedures, such as operating procedures, change-control procedures, issue management procedures, and data dispute resolution procedures. Additional policies and procedures should be considered for the communication processes, estimating guidelines, roles and responsibilities, and standard documentation formats.\nPlease look into various data quality articles and books.\n\n\nI think you are inquiring about the issue of data quality.

We are in our third year of our performance management journey but we are an organization that values continued improvement.  Nafia is new to our City so I thought I would share some of the current processes we have in place to ensure data validity and reliability which we are looking to improve upon.   \nWe currently meet with departments to review and refine their performance indicators as part of the budget process and we have Methodology Sheets to collect the important information related to each indicator (see attached).  This form is completed for each performance indicator and the contents of it is reviewed by Structural Innovation. Feedback, assistance, and guidance are then provided to departments to make necessary changes or provide clarification/corrections.    \nAdditionally, any time a department wants to stop tracking a measure or change something about the methodology a Performance Measure Change Form is required to be completed which also includes a field for signoff by the division head and/or department head. This form is submitted to Structural Innovation for review. This ensures that the methodology does not change mid-reporting frequency and when an issue does arise where the methodology needs to be updated, all parties agree on why it is necessary. Previous data then needs to either be adjusted to the new methodology or notated with the change.  \nFinally, all of this information is stored in our performance management system, ClearPoint. We use this software as a tool to monitor, report, and analyze the data for all of our performance indicators and strategic initiatives.   \nWe welcome the input and suggestions of our peers on our current processes and are interested in learning about the tools and procedures others use as well. Specifically, we are interested in learning more about internal auditing procedures for performance data as we would like to develop some guidance for departments to audit their data on a continual basis.\n\n\nI work in Structural Innovation in the City of Fort Lauderdale and we are continuously looking for ways to improve our approach to performance management.

  "text": "\n\nThank you for your previous feedback on your city and/or county\u2019s experience with performance measurement. I would like to clarify my question just a bit. \nDo any of you have an approach to make sure that the data is valid and reliable- that it can be recreated if needed in the future? The City of Fort Lauderdale is seeking to ensure that all departments are reporting data that is correct with a solid methodology. We are looking for different techniques other cities have used to show data reliability and validity for this purpose.\nThanks,\nNafia\n\n",
