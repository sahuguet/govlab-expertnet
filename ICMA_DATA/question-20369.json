This spring I needed to have the foundation raised--ground here moves--and the old brick sidewalk needed to be removed.  My new laying pattern is different than the old pattern so I am buying more pavers from the City (got my receipt telling how many at what price and telling the council I am doing it plus sending a PDF copy of the receipt to them so they can help with any ethics complaints).  Also, I just graduated to a smartphone.  In the afternoons, I will be trying to learn how to use it.\n\n\nI have been laying street paver bricks along one side of my house as I replace a sidewalk.

I hope this site, the Knowledge Network,  is not going to become that social web site.  I think it will diminish its value and reduce the number of people using it for research and information purposes less folks have to way through a large volume of social inputs. Both of these two goals, social and research, are valuable but should not be intermixed.  I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but we went through this on our blog in California and it took a couple of years to rebuild the value of the original site for research.\n\n\nI think there may be a good value in having a social blog site for ICMA members because getting to know each other on  personal level increase our network and candor.
