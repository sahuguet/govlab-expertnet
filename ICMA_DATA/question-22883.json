I am unsure of what kind of position you are interviewing for so it is hard for me to get more specific but I would encourage you to look at either the Jobs section of the website and find out what the posted starting salaries are for similar positions (http://icma.org/en/icma/career_network/job_seekers/browse_jobs) or to check out the sample job description documents as they include the salary from time to time (http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents). \nHere is the survey:icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/303353\nI hope you find these resources useful as you prepare for your negotiations and that other local government officials chime in and are able to provide you with more specific advice. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi, \n\nHere is a recent survey of salaries and all things related to them from ICMA.

  "text": "\n\nWhen it comes time to negotiate salary for a non-contractual position, is there generally acceptable percentage above the advertised salary that is acceptable to ask for? As a potential employee, obviously I am interested in getting as much as I can without throwing out a figure that is ridiculous to the employer. I do, however, feel my value is more than the advertised salary and this is a position I really want. Any advice on negotiating?\n\n",
