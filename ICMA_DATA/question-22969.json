There is also information on the CMS website at http://icma.org/en/results/management_strategies/leading_practices/priority-based_budgeting  and on the CMS Group page in the files section at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/groups/kn/group_files/1302  .  You will have to register as a group member to get access to these files.\nIf you are interested, I am also happy to schedule a free personal webinar for you from the folks at the Center for Priority Based Budgeting.  It may be a good way for you to see their approach without having to wade through the copies of the presentations on the Knowledge Network, which don't always include all of the information.  You can reach me at chilvert@icma.org\n\n\nHi Jerry!  The Center for Priority Based Budgeting is a preferred service provider of ICMA's Center for Management Strategies.

During my review I came across a page that listed sample budget presentations from municipalities and counties that utilized priority based budgeting.  I found the page intriguing but can't seem to  relocate the page. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
