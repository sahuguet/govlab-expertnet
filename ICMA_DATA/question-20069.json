  "text": "\n\nThe City of Goodyear, AZ is interested in any resources you may have regarding example Project Plans that outlines steps, necessary resources, and potential time frames for creating a municipal strategic plan.  The city is exploring creating a new strategic plan, but as part of the proposal, we need to give executive management a high-level overview of the process, i.e. how much time this may take to complete, what type of resources (staff, fiscal) this type of undertaking would involve, key tasks and milestones, etc. \nI am looking for an example project plan that you may have that we can use.  Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide!\nKim Bradford\nExecutive Management Assistant\nDeputy City Manager's Office\nCity of Goodyear - All-America City\n623.882.7073\nKim.Bradford@goodyearaz.gov\n\n",
