Some Sheriff\u2019s Departments use theirs to address issues brought up by citizens, some to help and teach youth, some to provide helpful charitable and promotional activities for their communities\u2014and most have combinations of those. It really depends on what you need done by the committee. Here are some specific examples of what various cities and counties do with theirs:\nThe County of Sacramento\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Outreach Community Advisory Board provides annual reviews to the Sheriff and Board of Supervisors about community complaints about police; reviews and comments on programs to promote, aide, and encourage community input; reviews and comments on the development and operation of the police department\u2019s law enforcement activities, and more. http://www.socab.saccounty.net/default.htm\nLewis and Clark County, MT, has a Community Outreach Unit whose jobs include safety presentations, career days, and internships for young men and women. http://www.co.lewis-clark.mt.us/departments/public-safety/sheriff/community-outreach.html\nThe City of Ithaca, NY has a Community Police Board with the purpose of serving as a forum for citizens to voice complaints and appreciation for the police department. http://www.ci.ithaca.ny.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B2EAD3CB7-DA0C-4D24-831A-8894D49863B5%7D&DE=%7B76CB5B5A-B99B-4853-8EFC-D3B1C3AE8F75%7D\nThe City of Alexandria, VA\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s office, while it does not have a specific committee or board for community outreach, publishes newspapers, hosts charity drives, and has internships for high schoolers.\nhttp://alexandriava.gov/sheriff/info/default.aspx?id=27410\nHennepin County, MN\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Department has a Community Outreach Liaison with the job of \u201cbuilding positive relationships with minority communities and youth.\u201d http://www.hennepinsheriff.org/content/about-hcso\n\n\nPamela,\nThere are a variety of different approaches you can take with your Community Outreach Advisory Board.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Rancho Cordodva', CA has a new Police Chief who is evaluating how to use the Chief\u2019s (or Community) Outreach Advisory Board which was put in place by the previous Chief.  We are interested to learn how other cities who have similar committees, boards, commissions, etc., are using a group like this for better two-way communication with the community.  \nThe Rancho Cordova Board has 11 people appointed for approximately 2 years and they are chosen for their diversity, geographic representation, etc.  They have developed bylaws, which they say they need just to govern their own conduct.  We envision using them more in our Neighborhood Watch groups, too.\nAny help, information, documentation that you can provide will be very helpful!\nStephanie Snyder\nSenior Management Analyst\nCity Manager's Office\nCity of Rancho Cordova\n916.851.8806\nssnyder@cityofranchocordova.org\n\n",
