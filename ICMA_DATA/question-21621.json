  "text": "\n\nBarron County is facing a situation wherein a large number of Frac Sand Mining companies want to ship large quantities of sand from the mining site to a dry processing plant or rail head by either quad-axle or semi-dump truck.  They will be utlilizing the County trunk highway system for this transfer of sand, up to 50 or 100 round trips per day on the same County road.  The result is the current County road system will not handle this volume of truck traffic.  \nMy question is has anyone else faced this or a similar situation and then defined the proposed road routes as high intensity thereby deriving revenues from those shippers who will be utlilizing the particular stretch of road?   If you have such a policy or something similar I would be intersted in receiving a copy.\nThank you!\n\n",
