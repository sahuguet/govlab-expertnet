The cost for an annual fixed cost contract that covers repairs and maintenance are less than the fully loaded costs of one I.T. employee. \n2.  An I.T. contract provides us with a team of professionals that have individuals skilled in various aspects of I.T. including software, hardware, servers, networking, peripheral devices, and telephones which requires a diverse knowledge base that is difficult for one person to possess. \n3.  With a contractor providing services, we do not have to worry about what we will do if our one I.T. employee is out for vacation or illness.

I would say that we've heavily leaned towards managed/outsourced IT in lieu of hiring IT professionals.

Consider both what you want, and more importantly how it will be measured.  Don't let a lack of familiarity with IT lead to a vendor exploiting on extra charges and time overruns.  Have a clear Service-Level-Agreement (SLA), and have the costs explicitly spelled out in the SOW or MSA contract docs.  \nAlso - invest the time into vendor due-diligence and reference/contact checks as well as formal RFI.  Every hour you spend will return 10x in dollar savings.\nWe reference this document religiously as a guide to entering into outsourcing relationships: http://www.cio.com/article/2439495/outsourcingutsourcing-definition-and-solutions/outsourcing/outsourcing-definition-and-solutions.html\nHope this helps!\n\n\nIn the technology industry, we're having this debate even about core services that our IT department has offered for decades.

      "text": "\n\nMr. Mirc:  Could you share some of your cost benefit analyses with the group?  I have had very different results when considering outsourcing some of my IT functions.  For example, when considering outsourcing our help desk, I found that it would be much more expensive to achieve the same level of service than it is to keep it in house with staff who perform other duties as well (we are a small shop).  I have found that outsourcing the more high level project-based work much more appealing -- however, the big caveat there is that you will still need significant in-house project management to be sure that the your interests are always being served and not the interests of the vendor.  Service vendors will always look to cut time and labor out in order to maximize profits.  Anyone who tries to tell you anything different is being na\u00efve or disingenuous.

We've looked at the following functions as managed services versus FTE's, and domestic versus offshore:\n\nServiceDesk (L1/L2) support\nApplication Maintenance and Support of legacy applications (Java, PhP, mainly)\nFront end report development (Business Objects)\nFront-end UX design (CSS, HTML)\nQuality Assurance\nSystem Administration (Linux)\n\nYou're absolutely right about looking at total cost of ownership versus nominal figures, as project management/professional services from outsource providers is where they cut corners tremendously in my experience.   Same thing in quality assurance.   \nWe've turned to onshore providers versus the traditional offshore providers for lower-skill functions.  IAOP, HfS and Gartner research suggest that a $17/hr breakpoint is where onshore versus offshore becomes economically feasible from a total cost perspective.  As per full-time versus outsourced, we use a 1.4x markup on FTE salary to consider full load benefits, etc.  We've had the greatest success in QA and App Support.   Still haven't gone with ServiceDesk - agree with your conclusions.\nLet me know if there's a specific area in which you're interested, happy to share our detailed analysis.\n\n\nMs. Carlson,\n\nI'd be happy to share some of our analysis.
