All of our volunteers fill out a complete employment application and we conduct a criminal and reference background check just as we would any other employee.  In essence, we \"hire\" our volunteers the same way we would a paid employee due to the fact that we are subject to the same liability as if they were an employee.  We have a mixed system where a few departments coordinate their selection process but the background checks are done by HR.  We do not drug test-though we do not for most employees anyway.\n\n\nHi Megan,\n\nWe are a small rural community of 8,100 located in northern Maine.
