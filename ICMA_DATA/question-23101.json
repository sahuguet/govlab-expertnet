  "text": "\n\nElizabethtown Borough, Lancaster County, PA is considering contracting for IT services. We currently have one staff member who handles IT in addition to her other duties.  Relying on one person is a cause of concern in times when she is out on leave or at training events.  I am looking for sample rfp's that other municipalities have used to seek similar proposals.  Any help would be most appreciated!  --Cindy\n\n",
