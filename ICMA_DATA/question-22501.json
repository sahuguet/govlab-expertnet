It sounds like your case is about as tough as it gets, because it involves ethical or even legal transgressions. First I would resolve to do nothing that violated the ICMA Code of Ethics. If a Council member asks you to violate them, explain to them that you will not - and explain why. Then for the sake of transparent communications, share the same message with the other Council members. Second I would evaluate whether it was possible to help facilitate a change of the political culture. Your decision should include an evaluation of the methods needed to make the change, your talents for facilitating them, and the associated risks (political and otherwise). Make sure that there are political forces in the community that will support you. You simply can't do it alone. Finally, if you can't see yourself fixing the situation, follow Brian's advice (above). Best wishes.\n\n\nI think each of us must decide whether we can help the local government we are working for.

It's hard to speak to your question without specifics, but you may consider hiring a consultant to provide some leadership and/or ethics training for your governing body.  \nThat being said, I think we as managers need to understand our own particular interests and skillset. Some managers thrive in a rapidly changing environment. Others prefer a slower pace.  Some really love the \"change agent\" title, while others prefer a more stable and progressive government. \nPersonally, I am drawn to cities that are politically stable, but have a few economic or development challenges. This is the environment where I am most comfortable and can render the best service. If I ever felt that my skillset was not a good fit I would seek other opportunities.\n\n\nAs you noted, communities change over time --- elected officials, demographics, culture --- which presents new opportunities and challenges.

Whether it be the current electeds, the potential new faces you'll have in an election, the changing demographics and direction of your community - what do you do when just don't believe in the place anymore? i.e. its leaders, its future, etc.\nI know as city management professionals our job is to effect positive change, but it's hard when you're directed to do the opposite by your electeds, or when there is just so much apathy or shameful greed that you're bound helpless as a professional. It doesn't help either when the entire metro area is becoming a rat's nest (or when was it ever not a den of thieves?).\n\n",
