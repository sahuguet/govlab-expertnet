I have had a number of interns who have dealt with police issues, website updating, DDA and ordinance writing. All of these require different skills, but having an intern who can write concise reports or present in front of council is extremely important. It is important you gain confidence in your ability to be a public speaker. If you have any further questions please feel free to e-mail me jsuchy@villageofdundee.net\n\n\nTimothy, the most important thing managers are looking for is a wide knowledge of a variety of topics and the ability to adapt to the work you are doing and finally the ability to communicate effectively.

      "text": "\n\nHi Timothy,\nThe above responses are helpful including your review of ICMA publications from a context perspective, concise writing skills and presentations are important, yet getting some hands on experience is going to be equally as important.  The above advice to volunteer to help with local government-related projects (from start to implementation) is realy valuable while you're in school.  You should make every effort to attend regular local government city/county management association gatherings and meet as many city manager and deputy managers in your region as possible.  When I started, I made appointments and interviewed city managers and asked them how they got to be where they are today -- this was the beginning of my initial network.  You should make a concerted effort to get to know the manager/deputy and depatment heads in your community.  You should be attending Council meetings, introduce yourself and see what volunteer opportunities there are in your city while attending school.  Your goal in school should be to position yourself in a practical sense.\nBeyond that, when you're close to graduation, you should go after every management internship or fellowship in a city manager's office that is out there.  You should be willing to relocate to get that first full-time position in a manager's office.  I moved from Spokane to West Palm Beach for my internship -- I didn't know a soul, it was sometimes hard, but it launched my career early on.\nInitial skill sets that are helpful when you start include project management, anything related to community relations and engagement, any opportunities to be part of an economic development project (DDA, CRA, merchants association, etc.) are in growing demand.  Working in any financial/budget capacity is also very helpful when starting - even volunteer opportunities can have a project budget aspect you can help with.\nFinally, you're going to have to work on getting over the introverted piece.  Join toast masters or put yourself into a position where you will have to interact and engage people.  As a practioner, I call on this skill daily. Sometimes in order to succeed, you need to put yourself out there in some uncomfortable ciscumstances. It's all about growth.\nHope these thoughts are helpful.  Good luck!\n\n\nHi Timothy,\n\nThe above responses are helpful including your review of ICMA publications from a context perspective, concise writing skills and presentations are important, yet getting some hands on experience is going to be equally as important.

  "text": "\n\nI am currently in the first semester of my MPA. I have a BPA from undergrad and some experience interning in local government. While I know I want a career in city management, I do not know what particular skills current professionals are looking for in MPA grads. Book knowledge only gets you so far. I have gotten involved in ICMA though. I am serving on the Knowledge Network Advisory Board and helping with the ICMA chapter at my university. Also the MPA program requires an internship. However, what I would like to know is, what skills are current managers in need of that students can develop to prepare for a career in local government?\nI feel I should also point out that I am very introverted.\n\n",
