      "text": "\n\nDuring the energy bust that decimated Grand Junction, Colorado, in the mid-1980's to early 1990's, our strategy for use of our fairly substantial capital improvement reserves was altered.  We called it the \"half (actually one-third) life\" policy.  Only one-third of these reserves were to be budgeted for capital projects in any year.  Each year only one-third of what remained from the previous year was to be committed.  The notion was to assure some level, although declining, of capital spending each year, keep some \"powder\" dry for emergencies and the uncertain economic conditions.  Along with our long range cip, it discouraged use for operating purposes, kept at least a modest pipeline of capital resources while we awaited an economic turn-around and helped win subsequent voter approval of a dedicated capital revenue stream (sales tax).  That downturn lasted four years to the bottom and another four-plus years bouncing along the bottom before any significant growth in revenues.\n\n\nDuring the energy bust that decimated Grand Junction, Colorado, in the mid-1980's to early 1990's, our strategy for use of our fairly substantial capital improvement reserves was altered.
