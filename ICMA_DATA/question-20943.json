This article details the decision of Farmers Branch, Texas to transition from distributing information packets to a paperless system. In assessing the system they have developed, the article ends with helpful benefits and cost-savings. There is also further contact information at the bottom of the article.\nhttp://bit.ly/ejTvjc\nFinally, I was able to locate a document that details three different options in going paperless. While it does not give a specific case study example, it gives good background information on paperless practices and the associated benefits and detriments. \nhttp://bit.ly/hpOfWF\nI hope this helps,\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Angel,\n\nI believe that I have found some documents that might be useful in answering your question. \n\nTo begin, there was a question asked very recently, in the past 18 hours, regarding paperless workflow policies and procedures.

I don't recall what system they started with but in the past 5 years we're using a system called Legistar which handles agendas from initiation to agenda packet and interfaces with MS Word as an editor.  The web-based exterior site is not as intuitive as some users would like but overall it has helped greatly to manage the process and publish the agenda.\n\n\nThe City of Ann Arbor went paperless about 9 or 10 years ago.

One of the \"modules\" you can purchase is the Agenda Creator module that does just what you describe - department heads or supervisors can create items, upload supporting documents, then send it up through the chain for approval and addition to the meeting agenda.  I'm not sure if you can purchase the module separately from the website package, but it was pretty simple to use if your clerk's office and department heads are internet/email savvy.  Granicus, a company that does streaming of meetings online, also partners with several agenda managment companies.  I went to a presentation a couple of years ago but can't for the life of me remember the name of the company that gave a presentation on their agenda system.  It was impressive, however.

  "text": "\n\nWe are in the process implementing an electronic agenda management system. I have read the question and responses in regards to utilizing technology to aid in agenda distribution and that provided a great source of information; however, this system would be implemented internally (for city staff). \nIdeally, any staff member who has an agenda item would upload it into the system and the item would go through a series of check points prior to being approved. Once all agenda items are approved they could be moved to the meeting folder available to council. \nThis is an attempt to go paperless. Are there any municipalities that currently have a similar system in place or another one that may be of interest? Thanks!\n\n",
