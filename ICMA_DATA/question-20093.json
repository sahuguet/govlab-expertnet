These teams include a County/City manager liason, department heads, budget analysts, subject matter experts and non-subject matter experts. The teams would come to a conclusion about which \"programs\" to suggest for the coming year and at what funding level when compared with similar programs trying to reach similar goals. This allowed the department heads and those lower in the organization to not just comment and learn about the budget process, but to actually partake and help create the new budget.
