  "text": "\n\nHello -\nI'm the administrator of a city that owns a small (49-bed) hospital, that is independently run by a non-profit agency chartered by the city.  This non-profit has now begun negotiations to enter into an affiliate partnership with a much, much larger hospital group.  This larger group would potentially purchase the hospital from the city, something the city is open to.\nI'd like to connect with others who have been in a situation like this, as I'm seeking advice/input on what issues we should be aware of, what we should look for in a purchase offer, what we should seek ourselves in a sale agreement, samples of sales agreements, names of consultants the city might work with to represent our interests (although we're not likely to hire anyone due to lack of funds), pros and cons of a sale versus a long-term or even a pre-paid lease.  \nThanks,\nDave Kanner\n\n",
