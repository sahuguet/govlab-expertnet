He said that he has \"read cautions and warnings about using such services to find any kind of job because there are many scammers and the fees can be high.\" Greg thinks you have done the right thing by contacting (and providing a resume) executive search firms that specialize in local government management recruitment and selection. He would caution that if you do decide to contract with a firm, although likely not necessary, that the detailed service(s) to be provided and the fees be clearly defined and in writing. \nHere is a link to an article on executive search firms and employment agencies:  http://jobsearch.about.com/od/searchfirms/a/headhunter.htm\n\n\nHi Jason, I talked to Greg Bielawski, head of ICMA's Range Rider Program and a retired manager.

  "text": "\n\nI am in transition and have been advised by professional friends to consider using professional head hunter services.  Additionally, I have been in contact with many of the Executive Recruitment firms who list jobs here at ICMA and elsewhere seeking local government managers.\nCan and will anyone give me some information about the pros and cons of this idea.  For example I can list with a company for about $340 for a lifetime membership.  I think this is pricey, and wonder if additional expenses may be required later, (i.e. portion of salary if they find me a job, various fees).\nThanks,\nJason\n\n",
