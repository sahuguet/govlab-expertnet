  "text": "\n\nKnowledge network:\nI am a current graduate student at DePaul University\u2019s School of Public Service in Chicago, Illinois.  I will be graduating this November and as part of my degree program I am conducting research for a capstone project.  \nMy research is looking at ethics among managers and assistant managers within cities/villages that operate under the council-manager form of government across the United States.  I am collecting my own primary data and am hoping to get a minimum of 40 responses from managers.  The survey I have created should take no more than 15 minutes and can be accessed at the below link. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to message me here or at jkohls@mail.depaul.edu or (612) 600-6228.\nAnonymous Survey Link: \nhttps://qtrial2014.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_agY3LYQevuHyzNH \nThank you in advance for your time,\nJustin Kohls\n\n",
