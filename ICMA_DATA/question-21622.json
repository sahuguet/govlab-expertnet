  "text": "\n\nI am- what seems-a career MIT. As such, when I first became a MIT, I started using the recruitment firms that specialize in our field. Most of the good positions (to use the term) are posted and handled by recruitment firms. However, I have found by experience that most-if not all- don't wish to invest the time and effort to \"deal\" with MIT's. I have even tried the standard things such as making efforts to establish personal relationships with them, updating my training and credentials, and networking with them at conferences. The most blatant are Bob Murray, the Mercer Group,and Peckham & McKenney... However, the rest all fall into this catagory. Has anyone else had similar experiences, and have you found ways to either \"work around\" this type of situaion or convince recruiters to be more open to working with you? Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\n",
