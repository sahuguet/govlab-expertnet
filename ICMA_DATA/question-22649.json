  "text": "\n\nOur County is considering allocating a portion of our county library funds specifically towards capital improvements for libraries.  We are looking at including a local match requirement of 25%.  We have five libraries in our county and are looking at issuing two awards a year.  I was wondering if anyone has experience with focusing funds to libraries specifically towards libraries.  Do you have suggestions on further leveraging these funds?  Thanks.\n\n",
