  "text": "\n\nWe are looking for another jurisdiction that has codified a phased zoning. We are nearing the end of a subarea planning process that includes a concurrent rezone of approximately a 1/2 mile radius around a future light rail station.  The area currently is almost exclusively zoned single family low density - residential 6 units per acre.  The proposed zoning is completely form based defined largely by the building heights 35 ft., 45 ft. and 85 ft. high zones.  The idea is to create a transit oriented community within a quarter mile of the station (apartments, jobs & commercial) and encourage transit supportive uses (small apartments, townhomes, small scale businesses) in the 1/4 -1/2 mile from the station.  \nThis opens a lot of single family zoned property up for redevelopment.  We are concerned that if \"opened up\" all at once, redevelopment will not transition well from the old to the new (spotty).  It is important to our Council that the entire area be rezoned now to ensure that the area develops into a Transit Oriented Community.  Staff has proposed the concept of \"phased zoning\" to rezone a smaller core now with additional phases of rezones to follow once certain thresholds of redevelopment have occurred.  The idea would be that once 50% of the total area or 50% of the total achievable density for example was developed in the first phase the second phase would be strategically chosen by adjacency to the developed portions of phase one and then be automatically rezoned from single family residential to the new pre determined transit supportive zone.  \nHas anyone used this approach?  Pros? Cons?\n\n",
