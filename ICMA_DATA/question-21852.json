  "text": "\n\nThe City of Charlottesville wants to revise its 5 year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) process and is interested in finding out more about CIP processes in other jurisdictions.  Specifically:\n\nWhat\u2019s the process city/county departments go through to request a capital project in any given year?  Do they submit application forms?\nDo you use staff and/or citizen teams to review requests?  What\u2019s the make-up of those teams and how effective are they?\nWhat are the criteria used to review the requests?\nWhat are some determining factors used to decide that a capital project will be included in the plan?\nAfter the capital budget is approved in any given year, does any on-going reporting occur for those approved projects?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
