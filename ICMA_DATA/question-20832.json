We could not have done this without the automation.  We have 3M selfchecks and Lyngsoe materials handling.   It has been surprisingly reliable and again..invaluable.  For all of the tags, tagging stations, pads, 5 selfchecks, the conveyors and self check-ins it ran us about 700,000.00    (It was part of our new building)   We do about 85% selfcheck.   Patrons are pretty pleased to be able to help themselves.   AV has proved a challenge.   Playaways are a real challenge.    As I stated, we could not function without this system.

      "text": "\n\nClearwater does not have RFID yet, or use automated sorting, but we went to all self-checkout this last year to help us compensate for the recent loss of staff.  Not allowing a choice to have someone check you out has not been the most popular move we have ever made, but it has made it possible to go from 2 or 3 people on the circ desk to one much of the time.  We made a conscious decision to make people using the machines as independent as possible, providing coin boxes that allow people to pay their fines with coin, cash, debit or credit cards, and mechanisms that allow one AV to be unlocked when it is checked out.  The machines have not been completely without problems, but they have been pretty reliable and fairly intuitive for the users.  Which is not to say our public likes to be told that they can't do it the way they always have.  With our 3 biggest locations each having a circulation close to Andy White's at about 350,000 a year, this is a critical element in providing service.\n\n\nClearwater does not have RFID yet, or use automated sorting, but we went to all self-checkout this last year to help us compensate for the recent loss of staff.

      "text": "\n\nDeborah - I'd talk to your catalog vendor. There may be relatively inexpensive ways to get to self check. We spent $2,500, plus the cost of a PC, per machine to put in self check. Our catalog vendor is Sirsi/Dynix and they have a relationship with a company called Envisionware.  We pushed it out fairly recently, with holds out and unlocking keys for the DVDs next to the self-check stations, which are on our circ desk. At any rate, we quickly jumped up to the self checks doing 35% of circ and are heading higher. People like them and find them easy to use, unless they don't. Some folks just prefer to have the relationship with staff.  Others prefer the convenience. Our service pop is about 20K and we do 500K circ per year. Good luck.\n\n\nDeborah - I'd talk to your catalog vendor. There may be relatively inexpensive ways to get to self check. We spent $2,500, plus the cost of a PC, per machine to put in self check.
