I use these individal meetings to dsicuss the most sensitive issues we face in councilmember/staff interactions and with citizens. I specifically discuss the offending behavior to better understand why it occurs and offer suggestions on how the councilmember can better their needs. I do establish boundaries so councilmembers won't be surprised if I oppose their actions and I seek the help of the Mayor to address inappropriate council behavior. If the Mayor is the offending party, I'll work with the Vice Mayor.  At the end of the day, I am prepared to lose my job to maintain the integrity of the city charter.\n\n\nMartha,\nLike Lawrence said, it CM's nightmare.

The elected officials serve as mayor on a rotating basis for nine months.  The present mayor is serving his second four-year term that expires in March, 2013.  I and other residents feel his violates the principles and practices of an elected official in a democracy.\nIn a recent letter to a local newspaper, he stated: \"I continually ask that the local \u201cgadflys\u201d (sic) at least inform the residents of the actual facts instead of the usual \u201cmisdirection\u201d tactics they always rely on.  \nMaybe one of the \u201cgadflys\u201d (sic) should try for council?

Among the Letters to the Editor I have cited is one that relates to a 2006 City Council decision involving undergrounding in which Councilmember Montgomery voted to accept $80,000 to the city from a group seeking council approval on a contested issue involving its desired departure from established city policies and practices.  In my view, it is an example of the \u201cmisdirection\u201d tactics that Mr. Montgomery decries\nPositive Gadflies vs. Negative Gadflies.  At the last city council meeting, Mayor Montgomery defiantly reaffirmed his scourge of these gadflies.  However, he went on to argue that there are positive gadflies (those who provide constructive criticism) and negative gadflies (those who complain and criticize).  \nSince a gadfly, by definition, is a person who persistently annoys or stirs up others, we are left with Mr. Montgomery\u2019s semantic challenge to decide by innuendos just who are these negative gadflies?  Are they our neighbors who wrote the letters in my list sharing their depth of concerns regarding Mr. Montgomery\u2019s actions?  Not in my judgment.  \n\u201cDo your homework,\u201d Mr. Montgomery demands, lest he call you a gadfly.  But has he done his?  He pontificates but does not specify.  Request Mr. Montgomery to blazon out his list of negative gadflies and provide them an opportunity to come before your tribunal.  \nHe states \u201cfreedom of speech works both ways.\u201d  That is true.  Therefore, give these so-called negative gadflies an opportunity to defend themselves against their \u201cinaccurate statements,\u201d \u201cwild accusations,\u201d and \u201coutright lies.\u201d Or, as he put it, \u201cHow\u2019s that for equal justice!\u201d  \nGet Your Facts Right!  Or else, Mr. Montgomery says, he will respond!  This leads to the essence of public service and the pride of being a public employee or an elected official.  Every day you are charged with the responsibility of confronting issues that deeply impact our lives\u2014our livelihood, our homes, our safety, the education of our children, the care of our seniors\u2014in sum, the quality of our existence.  \nBut not without a price, because we often come to you with opposing views based on deeply held value differences where if we \u201ccompromise\u201d we feel we have \u201ccompromised\u201d our integrity.  And, so our emotions erupt and do they erupt!  Not only directed at each other but also at you in the form of criticism and complaints.\nYet, getting us to \u201cget our facts right\u201d is harder than making simple pronouncements because our values filter our perception of the \u201cfacts.\u201d  And, all the facts in the world cannot prove one value better than another, one belief better than another or one feeling better than another.  \nAs I state in my letter, \u201cAmerican democracy is built on forging divergent interests and values within our community into solutions that maximize our long-term viability.\u201d  When President Kennedy said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,\u201d he was asking us to put aside our value differences for the common good.  That is the heart of great political leadership.\nOur Public Employees.  We are fortunate to have the finest city employees.  Every day, they too, face the pressures and challenges similar to those of elected officials.  However, as elected officials you set the standards.  \nThat being the case, do you want our city employees to adhere to Mr. Montgomery\u2019s standards and condone the stereotyping and treatment of our residents as gadflies?  Are you willing to accept the employees\u2019 defense of this characterization, \u201cWell, if the Mayor can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d\nWe are also fortunate to live in a community with so many of our neighbors shaping the city\u2019s soul and character by their outpouring of volunteerism, philanthropy, and concern for those in need.    \nIt is a critical time for our city.  \u201cTimes they are a-changing\u201d and forging new directions to ensure our viability was never more challenging and never more in need of both compassionate and decisive leadership.  I wish you well.\nThank you for your service.\nI plan to raise further awareness by informing other residents and requesting assistance from the South Bay Council of Governments, the Independent Cities Association, and other community groups.  \nAm I doing the right thing?  Are there other steps I should take?  What should our new city manager do?\nThank you.\nEdward C.

Not only directed at each other but also at you in the form of criticism and complaints.\n\nYet, getting us to \u201cget our facts right\u201d is harder than making simple pronouncements because our values filter our perception of the \u201cfacts.\u201d  And, all the facts in the world cannot prove one value better than another, one belief better than another or one feeling better than another.  \n\nAs I state in my letter, \u201cAmerican democracy is built on forging divergent interests and values within our community into solutions that maximize our long-term viability.\u201d  When President Kennedy said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,\u201d he was asking us to put aside our value differences for the common good.  That is the heart of great political leadership.\n\nOur Public Employees.  We are fortunate to have the finest city employees.  Every day, they too, face the pressures and challenges similar to those of elected officials.  However, as elected officials you set the standards.  \n\nThat being the case, do you want our city employees to adhere to Mr. Montgomery\u2019s standards and condone the stereotyping and treatment of our residents as gadflies?  Are you willing to accept the employees\u2019 defense of this characterization, \u201cWell, if the Mayor can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nWe are also fortunate to live in a community with so many of our neighbors shaping the city\u2019s soul and character by their outpouring of volunteerism, philanthropy, and concern for those in need.    \n\nIt is a critical time for our city.  \u201cTimes they are a-changing\u201d and forging new directions to ensure our viability was never more challenging and never more in need of both compassionate and decisive leadership.  I wish you well.\n\nThank you for your service.\n\nI plan to raise further awareness by informing other residents and requesting assistance from the South Bay Council of Governments, the Independent Cities Association, and other community groups.  \n\nAm I doing the right thing?  Are there other steps I should take?  What should our new city manager do?\n\nThank you.\n\nEdward C. Caprielian, Ph.D.\n(310) 546-2345\necapriel@csulb.edu\n\n\nSave Changes\nCancel\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "\n\nAdvice on how to deal with an elected official who seems not to understand their role and interferes with the city/county manager's role would be most helpful.  For example, what do you do when the elected official contacts vendors to inquire about the status of a project or makes demands about the work?  What do you do when an individual council member wants to be consulted or have input on personnel decisions that are the manager's responsibility? Do you discuss this privately with the individual? If that doesn't seem to work, do you notify the entire governing body? Ignore the situation?  Based on your experience, what approach seems most effective?\n\n",
