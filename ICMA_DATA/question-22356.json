      "text": "\n\nWe have had take home vehicles since the late 1980's.  The initial start up cost is a bear, but overall, we believe it does cost less in the long run.  The officers do take better care of their vehicles, and are responsible for getting them in for service at the regular intervals.  The vehicles are essentially their offices, since they spend so much time in them and have the MDTs.   We have around 130 in the fleet, and probably replace about 10 per year, based on mileage and age of the vehicle.  The vehicles last longer since they are not being run 24/7.  The PD does have a policy in place that prevents use for non-governmental travel, and since the vast majority of the vehicles are marked, it hasn't been that hard to enforce.\n\n\nWe have had take home vehicles since the late 1980's.

As most of the cities around us offered them, we felt we needed to do it in order to remain competitive.  We do feel that the officers take better care of the vehicles though since it is their assigned vehicle and they are more attuned to its maintenance needs.  Our policy permits the vehicles to travel a maximum distance to their homes (either 20 or 25 miles...would have to double check the policy).  If their home is beyond that, they have to park it at a police or fire station within that radius.  Their addresses are audited periodically to ensure they're in compliance with this.

  "text": "\n\nHow many of your Police Departments have a \"take home\" fleet where individual officers are assigned their own patrol car? I am being told that this fleet management method saves dollars because officers are more inclined to take better care of an individual car than a shared vehicle. I find this somewhat difficult to believe for several reasons that I won't go into here. I would be curious as to everyone's thoughts on this type of system.\nIf you have this type of system, what rules or regulations do you have to ensure that patrol cars are only used to public uses?\nThanks.\n\n",
