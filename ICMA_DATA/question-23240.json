You might ask state/federal government shops in your area, or companies with similar kinds of fleet.\nBut this is important! One of my dad's good stories is about how he got a landscaping job with the federal government in DC. Part of the interview was a driving test on a dump truck. Dad started to do his normal walkaround of an unfamiliar rig, and the supervisor suggested they just hop in and go. Dad demurred and looked under the hood. The brake fluid tank was completely dry: this test drive might have gone very badly. Supervisor, a bit pale in the face, just about hired Dad on the spot.\nGood luck!\n\n\n:/ sometimes this kind of document stays on clipboards and doesn't make it online easily. \n\nIt matters what kind of fleet you have --lots of heavy diesel, hydraulics, small engine, etc. --and the check could have a universal set of things for every piece every time, or it could be specific to different types.
