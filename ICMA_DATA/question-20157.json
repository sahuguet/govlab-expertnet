During post-review, we have a management intern disseminate information to division directors and department heads conerning new or amended laws and state budget issues that may affect our programs or sevices. During the interim, County Commissioners and myself attend policy conferences during the summer sponsored by the Association of County Commissioners in Georgia (ACCG) to hear and discuss further impacts and the prospects for upcoming bills. The management intern then performs a pre-legislative review in the fall where we use a survey instrument and then caucus again with division/department heads to develop a legislative platform to present to our local delegation, or as appropriate or necessary, ACCG or a contract lobbyist.  We approach federal issues on a more ad hoc basis.\n\n\nIn Bulloch County, Georgia we have a pre- and post-legislative legislative review process focused upon our state General Assembly which is part-time and generally meets from Jan.-Apr.
