  "text": "\n\nThis sounds like a crazy question, but has anyone developed standards/criteria for purchase of office furniture? We are running into situations where the threshold for what is needed or wanted for office chairs is as varied as the number of directors we have. How do you determine replacement? Do you have a standard set? Dollar amount? We have some buying $59 cheap chairs at big box and others are purchasing $1600 chairs. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
