  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have a relatively current contract for 9-1-1 dispatch services between a municipality and a private, quasi-private, quasi-public entity that they would be willing to share?   If so, please email to nbeets@windhamct.com.   I am the Town Manager for Windham, CT, and we are drafting a dispatch contract with a 501 (c) (3) entity, and want to see what others have done.  Of course, as soon as possible.  Thank you.\n\n",
