  "text": "\n\nGood afternoon,\nThe City of Tracy is exploring ways to consolidate four city commissions.  Does anyone have any insight or best practices that outline the most innovative way to consolidate commissions?  \nFor example, rather than having a senior commission, youth commission and arts commission a general commission would be created with one representative from each population/group?\nAny and all insight is appreciated!  Thank you.\n\n",
