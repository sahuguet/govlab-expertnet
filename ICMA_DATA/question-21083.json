  "text": "\n\nThe City of Sunnyvale, CA is gearing up for a parade for their centennial celebration. They are interested in costing information that you might be able to provide re: the parade(s) s you\u2019ve coordinated in you agency.  Obviously there are many contingencies, such as police overtime rates, size of parade etc., but, whatever data you might have that says for example, \u201cour city sponsored a one mile parade and it cost approximately $__\u201d, that would be hugely helpful.  Or even the total number of staff hours devoted to planning and running the parade would be useful.\nThank you\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
