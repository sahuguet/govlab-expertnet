The outsourcing did not cost much more than doing it in-house and now our crews can spend a lot more time in the fall focusing on pavement repairs and forestry operations. And as you suggest, one of the biggest down sides of doing it in-house was the capital and maintenance costs of equipment. Our service provider also has GPS installed on their equipment so our front desk staff can monitor the pickups which helps with phone calls. So, overall the benefits of outsourcing this particular service outweigh any benefits from doing it in-house, at least for our organization.\n\n\nWe outsourced this after many years of doing it in-house.
