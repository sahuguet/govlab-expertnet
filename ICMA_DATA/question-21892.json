I am also proposing that employees meet a specific goal per quarter in order to receive their HSA contribution from the city.  Those activities would include a biometric screening, an annual physical, completion of a health risk assessment and completion of a specific wellness topic coaching.  This year we did a similar program that earned points toward HSA funding.  I see a premium difference for obesity in the next 5 years.\n\n\nSharonville, Ohio is proposing programs as you describe for the first time next year.

  "text": "\n\nIn an effort to contain health insurance premiums and support employee wellness/workplace productivity, we are searching for examples of organizations that have implemented a wellness compliance model. Many organizations require employees to participate in health risk assessments and may require those employees who refuse to participate to pay more towards their health insurance.  Is anyone requiring employees to comply with the outcome of a health risk assessment?  For example, if an employee smokes does he/she have to contribute more to their health insurance; or if a person is obese, are they required to pay more towards their health insurance?\n\n",
