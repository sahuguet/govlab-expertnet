      "text": "\n\nWhereas both Lean and Six Sigma systems are basically designed to limit or eliminate variation in a process, I see them as being substantially not-well suited to public safety process improvement initiatives. The issue for me is twofold. First, not withstanding our need to account for quality, we are really measuring how long it takes to do things. If we can move a call through a dispatch center quickly and its processing time is more standard deviations from the mean processing time than we have set as a goal, did we fail? Of course not.  \nSecond, many aspects of public safety are simply not studied well enough to establish what the likely and desirable inputs and outcomes are and ought to be in given circumstances. Whereas a manufacturer knows exactly what they want their product to do and why, public safety is in many ways still not articulate about what outcomes constitute success and why in given areas. Until the desired outcomes have been fully articulated, it is not advisable to do intensive process improvement the likes of Lean and Six Sigma. If, for example, a fire is tenacious and takes a long time to put out, is that bad?  If a domestic dispute takes longer than usual to resolve but no one has to go to jail, is that bad? If, on the other hand, someone has to go to jail, is that bad? If a caller to a 911 center cannot be thoroughly interrogated due to their own injuries and a speech impediment, is that a system failure? In an environment where standardization of a process is a critical factor in determining success (for example, making microchips exactly the same way every time,) then these systems are very valuable. Where variation is normal, appropriate, and expected, there are other ways to measure success.\nWith regard to dispatch centers, there are \u201cstandards\u201d such as NFPA 1221 that establish upper thresholds but not lower thresholds. These are probably better suited to a process that one does not necessarily want to fit into a normal distribution, but instead wants to make as short as possible given some expectations about the uniformity of the output. Think of it as CPR versus auto manufacturing. In CPR you would love for your patient to get a pulse back on the very first compression and to have the event be in the parking lot of the hospital with the cath lab so your transport time would be minimal. You wouldn\u2019t consider it a process failure if that happened. In auto manufacturing, however, you want your car to go through the assembly line in exactly the amount of time you specify, not a shorter time or a longer time. Lean and Six Sigma \u2013 which are often used together \u2013 work well in the latter example, but are not great in the former. The former, as I suggest above, is also complicated by the fact that our outcomes and objectives are not always rooted in great (if any) scientific inquiry.\n\n\nWhereas both Lean and Six Sigma systems are basically designed to limit or eliminate variation in a process, I see them as being substantially not-well suited to public safety process improvement initiatives.

Much has been written about the pros and cons of LSS, and while it may work best for repeatable manufacturing processes, it has also been successfully applied to many other environments.  Many organizations dedicated to promoting Quality, such as ASQ and iSixSigma, have a multitude of case studies and testimonials about how LSS has been successfully applied to transactional processes--everything from courts and law offices to emergency rooms to the federal government and the military.  Just about everything is a process with inherent variation, but the goal is to understand how the process performs and to optimize that process given the constraints, and LSS can be used to do this.         \nOften times negative perceptions of LSS is a result of misapplication of the tools and methodology, such as not considering the customer, lack of top leadership support, and not acknowledging that drastic changes in organizational culture may be needed before LSS or any type of Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) approach can be successfully implemented.  The author indirectly supports the belief that is often used to resist process improvement, namely \u201cwe are different and we can\u2019t be measured\u201d which can reinforce a culture that eschews accountability and performance excellence.  The fact is that many public safety organizations are rich with data, but whether that data is usable and whether the leadership is really serious about using the data to manage performance is another question.     \nI encourage the reader to do the research themselves and talk to others that have different views on the subject\u2014some examples are the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Department (look near the bottom of that blog), an article about the courts in England, an article in IACP, and an upcoming webinar on LSS  (click on the banner on that site) hosted by Kronos and Governing.com (links are provided below in order).
