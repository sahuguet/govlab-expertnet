      "text": "\n\nDick,\nThe City of Oklahoma City is currently studying the effects and cost that vacant and abandoned properties are having on city services and what actions Oklahoma City might consider to reduce those negative impacts on our City and citizens.  While the situations across the nation are far from identical, the challenges that communities face from vacant and abandoned properties are similar: reduced nearby property values, increased criminal activities, accelerated community decline, and an increased need for city services.  Evidence shows these properties are an expense that local government simply can\u2019t afford and the expense and blight grows with every year a property remains vacant.  In response to those demands, we are preparing a report for City Council considering a possible property registration and fee for the disproportionate cost of these properties, which we expect to be forthcoming in the next few months.  The best source that we have found in our research for a comprehensive listing of local and state governments with vacant property registration is at http://www.safeguardproperties.com/Resources/Vacant_Property_Registration/Default.aspx?filter=vpr\nThey have several examples from cities/counties in GA.\nFeel free to contact me in a few months to see if we have a final report.\nMichael J.
