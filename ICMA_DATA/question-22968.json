  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone work for a city that owns and operates its own street sweeping truck?  We currently contract for street sweeping service, but there has bee some interest expressed in doing it in-house.\nI need to develop some cost comparisons for contracting for service versus the initial and ongoing costs associated with owning and operating a street sweeping truck.  I have thought of the following costs, but please let me know if there are any I am forgetting:\n\nInitial cost of the vehicle\nSalary and benefits of employee operator\nTraining and certifications necessary for the operator\nAnnual maintenance costs\nInsurance costs\n\nI'd appreciate any data or cost that could be shared, whether broken down or the total budgeted amount for the program.\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
