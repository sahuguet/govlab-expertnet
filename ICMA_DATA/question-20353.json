This is a reasonable strategy because the alternative would be to pay a salary high enough to cover area mortgages.  Housing assistance can include funds for a down payment and/or loan assistance.  The loan should be secured so that the local government's interest is covered and the terms of the loan as well as repayment should be clearly spelled out in an agreement.  For example, who benefits from any gain in equity?   Having the city own a home that they rent to the manager isn't always a desirable option because the manager doesn't have the benefit of home ownership, the home may not be suitable to the family's needs,  and the city has yet another structure to maintain.  Examples of housing assistance are included in the ICMA Model Employment Agreement.
