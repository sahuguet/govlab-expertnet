While we do not have an article that will give you an example of such an arrangement we do have an article \"Public Safety Radio System Needs Analysis and System Design\"  that walks through the development of a functioning  model. The development of a funding model is found in the second portion of the document. I hope this helps with the creation of your radio station.\nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/6745/Request_for_Proposal_Public_Safety_Radio_System_Needs_Analysis_and_System_Design\nBest,   \nRobin Saywitz  \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern  \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Joseph,   \nThank you for your question on local government partnerships with non-profits.

  "text": "\n\nWe have been approached by a new nonprofit that seeks to start a local radio station that will cover 5 local communities.  The nonprofit has informed us that the FCC announced that it will open up FM frequencies for the first time in quite a while. Upon hearing this news, the non-profit organization Underwood V was started, in hopes of obtaining one of those frequencies. The FCC has a limited number of frequencies available, and we must be able to prove that our station will be a success. The group is wondering if the city would be willing to work with us by providing a place for our antenna and possibly some office space. \nDo any communities have any experience with such an arrangement?\n\n",
