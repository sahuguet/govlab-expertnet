  "text": "\n\nWhen does a council so dilute the independence of a manager that it is no longer to be recognized as a council manager form of government?  Our Board yesterday completely revoked the County Manager Ordinance which established the duties and respective authority of the Council relative to the Manager and sent a very strong message that the Board will have the say over who gets terminated whether the manager agrees with them or not.  They also very clearly and publicly stated that employees could bypass the manager and come straight to the Board if they so choose.  How far does the relationship have to go toward being a pure ministerial position before it no longer serves as a valid council-manager position?  Is this something that ICMA monitors as it becomes aware of jurisdictions that make these sort of changes?  Has anyone else experienced these types of issues, and if so, what have the results been over the long term.\n\n",
