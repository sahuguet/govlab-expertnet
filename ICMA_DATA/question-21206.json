So when a department is \"under budget\" for the year, they get to keep 50% of that as a re-appropriation the next year. Another 15% goes into a \"central savings\" account, and the remaining 35% returns to fund balance. The department may use it for any purpose that doesn't set up a recurring expense. Central savings are used at the City Manager's discretion. The balance left accumulates and is rolled over each year.\n\n\nOur efforts are not focused on cutting budgets, but on not spending all of your budget at the end of the year under some kind of \"spend it or lose it\" fear.

In my experience this is mostly a myth. \nInternally, the budget allotments set in the departmental budget review process are set months ahead of the final budgets going to council (and employees rushing to spend that last cent). At that point in time the \"year-to-date\" figures are quite telling as to the burn rate of expenditures. If the rate is resonable in relation to prior years actuals, (especialy 3rd Qtr to 3rd Qtr) then that is evidence that the end of the year budget spend-a-thon isn't really happening.\nMany managers often hold back on more discretionary purchases until near the end of the year to make sure that they will have sufficient appropriations. That does not mean that they are not appropriate purchases. \nBuying bulk office supplies at the EOY may mean that additional purchases are not made until late in the subsequest 2nd quarter. The real question is more like \"are we carrying excessive inventories?\" \nA study of actual purchasing patterns over the course of a year may give you the information as to whether you are truly stopping unnecessary spending, or merely constructing process to combat a problem that might not really exist.\n\n\nJust an observation on the \"spend it or lose it\" concern.

I think it's a great idea if you can get the backing to do it. The book \"The Price of Government\" by Osborne and Hutchinson describes this strategy breifly. In it they mention that any savings going back to departments should only be used for one-time projects that will enable them to work even more effeicently and effectively in the future. Good luck.\n\n\nMichael,\nThis is something that I've wanted to do for a while, but seems tough to implement based on political sensativity. However, that being said.

GFOA had a local finance director discuss an incentive program in use in his city. Many years later, interested in such a program, I contacted the community to get long-term results of their program. The initial response was that there had been no such program. I checked my notes, named the individual who had represented the issue, and was subsequently advised that the program had been eliminated shortly after I had heard about it. Departments had learned to game the system \u2013 not an unusual consequence in the field of government budgeting. The lesson I think I learned from that experience is that the concept may work as a one-time exercise. Even then, there are challenges that remain. High priorities tend to get appropriations -- anyway. Carrying over funds to be spent on lower priorities could be sending the wrong message. More importantly, bear in mind that some departments have control over expenditures to a greater degree than others. I refrain from describing that as discretionary spending because that is too narrow a view.\nI\u2019ve recently learned a different lesson: I competed for a County Manager position in a nearby jurisdiction. In my interviews with county commissioners, I described my intent to consider a county-wide challenge to create recurring savings and to dedicate a portion of the first year\u2019s savings to a one-time bonus for all employees. Employees were facing yet another year without pay increases, the loss of a significant number of positions in recent years, and a mandated contribution to retirement plans. I thought I might avoid budget gimmicks and permanently reduce spending. Since I was not selected, I may refrain from discussing such a strategy in the future until I have actually inked a contract but I like the concept of a team effort over any process that reinforces departmental silos.\n\n\nThis is a great issue for discussion.

We would like to offer departments who can cut their budgets a certain percentage of that money back for a project of their choosing. Does anyone have a program or policy similar to this in place?
