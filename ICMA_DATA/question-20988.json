  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance members would like to have information on developing a cost benefit algorithm for our investment fund program plus how to quantify direct and indirect costs.  We would like to have a tool that would help with decision making on selecting what projects to invest our funds for innovative projects in the County.  We\u2019ve been using cost benefits such as cost savings, cost avoidance, and revenue generation but we need something that will help us project out several years on the benefits each project would generate.  \nYour thoughts, ideas, suggestions or copies of resources you\u2019re using would be very helpful and appreciated.\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
