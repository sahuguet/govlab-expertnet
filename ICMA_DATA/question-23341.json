Most Fire Departments we have worked with - maintaining hydrants is included in their job descriptions and within the collective bargaining agreement terms. \n\nAs a former CM, LDS member and former Boy Scout Commissioner, you have some additional options. \n\nSome use local LDS (Mormon) youth groups for service projects (they do it at no cost). \nMany Boy Scout troops will do it for free as part of someone's Eagle Scout Projects - depending on the number of hydrants you need done - you could really get quite a few done.  \n\nGoing back to the City Manager with $3,000 - $5,000 in cost savings could be a real 'atta-boy'. \nIf you need help contacting some local troops or LDS youth groups in the area, I can give you a hand (no charge for my services) - just trying to help. \nDavid Evertsen, CEO\nMunicipal Solutions llc\ndevertsen@municipalsolutions.org\nMobile 623.207.1309\n\n\nHi Adam. \n\nMany municipalities I have worked with are also trying to reduce costs.
