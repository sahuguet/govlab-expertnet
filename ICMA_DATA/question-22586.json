  "text": "\n\nWe (The Town of Chapel Hill) have recently completed a multi-phased lighting project in our Council Chambers, installing LEDs to replace ALL other lighting types in the room: Fresnel studio lighting, fluorescent T-8 lighting, recessed incandescent lighting, and various types of decorative/accent lighting are all LEDs now. We\u2019ve found other case studies of municipalities where some LEDs were installed in a main public meeting space but have yet to find a 100 percent LED retrofit. Does anyone else claim to be the first \u201cLED Chamber\u201d in the nation? If there are others, can you share your experience?\n\n",
