  "text": "\n\nIn conjunction with the International Committees for ICMA and Massachusetts, we are seeking host cities for three study tours.  Language not an issue.\n1) We have two Mayors from Colombia seeking to participate in a study tour starting the last day of the conference and visiting one city each day for the 25th, 26th and 27th of September.  The primary focus of their interest is in Tourism development and innovative revenue resources.\n2) We have seven officials from Mexico who seek a one day study tour the day prior to the conference on September 20.  They have a particular interest in transportation and in the funding strategies for transit.\n3) A group of approximately four officials from Kenya will attend the conference, and they are seeking a study tour similar in length to that of the Mayors from Colombia: one city per day starting on the afternoon of the 25th and one city each day for the 26th and 27th.\nAll study tours are responsibile for their own expenses, etc.  There are no financial obligations for hosting communities.  If you would like to participate and to Host, please call Nancy Burke at:  781-238-8880,  ext. 101.
