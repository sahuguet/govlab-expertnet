  "text": "\n\nMany communities have banners attached to streetlights. These banners may advertise a local community event or institution. Manatee County, FL is investigating the possibility of doing the same but is wondering what guiding policies other communities use.\nWe were considering a right-of-way use permit and maintenance agreement for the banners. Who pays for maintenance / installation? Who can use the brackets? Is it limited to use / language?\nAny success with installing / cooperating with power company to mount on power poles?\nIn addition, we are looking for information on the specific hardware and any other obvious advice that could be provided. Thank you!\nJohn Osborne, Planning Official\nManatee County, FL\n\n",
