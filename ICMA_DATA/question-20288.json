Selectmen receive their executive (pending litigation, etc.) agendas and packets in advance of that. All public meeting notices are also posted electronically. \nHowever, there are a number of factors that prevent total paperless BOS meetings. First, Connecticut has robust public meeting notification requirements, so electronic posting alone will not satisfy the law. Secondly, and more importantly, the generational diversity in Town and strong tradition of civic engagement preclude any discussion of doing away with the hard copy of anything. We simply would not be delivering a desired service if we stopped producing paper copies of the agenda for the public. \nPlease forgive me if I misunderstood your question.\n\n\nGreenwich distributes our agenda and non-executive Board of Selectmen (city councils out west) agenda and packets to press and our website no later than 72 hours before the time of the meeting.

In addtion to the cost savings realized, they are also indicating that council meetings are running more smoothly as members require less time to flip through large paper agendas. Bookmarks and shortcuts can easily be inserted to a single PDF document that is distributed to all members of the meeting.\nFor more information on this you should contact John Eagle in Hampton, VA.\n\n\nThe city of Hampton, Virginia distributed IPads to all council members and senior management in order to move to a completely paperless council agenda process. \n\nFrom my brief conversations with the jurisdiction they are indeed realizing savings and reporting that the IPads will pay for themselves in as little as six months.
