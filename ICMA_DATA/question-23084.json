There are those individuals who do indeed have fragile medical needs, off the top of my head an individual with an insulinoma, they cannot control their blood sugar level and even though they are referred to the proper physician it may go undetected for months.  There are also those individuals that call because they like the attention\u2026.\nSo here\u2019s what we do, second or third time out we work with the hospital (ED Physicians) and we all talk and discuss the individual\u2019s case to see if there is a common theme.  We do a very detailed history and physical exam  and assess their environment (assure safety, may be they call due to fear).  We talk with the individual and also see what the ED physician(s) think.  If it does not seem to be medical we make a referral to social services.  If it is medical we\u2019ll see if they need an alternative pathway i.e. visiting nurse, home health aide, or ask their physician if they need some other type of care because of the number of times they call for help.\nIf they consistently refuse transport and there is no medical issue we tell them were going to make a social service referral because we can\u2019t meet their needs.  If there is a medical issue we also tell them that we\u2019re going to make a referral because we do not have the capacity to continually respond to them and they need care beyond what we can provide.\n\n\nFrom our EMS Chief...\nLike most things in medicine\u2026it all depends.
