We are working on scheduling an awesome event with a keynote speaker, concurrent sessions, installation of new officers and time for networking (yes, this is a group of overachievers!).  But we need a name for this new, jam packed event. \nName that Event Competition:  Submit your suggestions to vicepresident@mmasc.org by Monday, May 23 to enter the contest. One submission will win free admission to the event.\n\n",
