      "text": "\n\nThe Village of Bellaire (Antrim County) attempted this in 2000-2001. It polarized the community and the process ultimately failed for a variety of reasons. Primarily, the local population was not/refused to be educated on the subject. There was also not enough grass-roots support (it became a referendum on the Village Council) and much open support was fair weather, at best.\nAlso, Bellaire is bisected by two townships and the majority of Village business owners live in the townships. The townships were adamant against this process and were willing to spend any amount of money necessary to defeat it. Ultimately, it became an issue of how the Village was trying to steal money from the townships. Also, the County government involved itself in the process and tried to inject themselves in the process on behalf of the townships.\nAlso, the State Boundary Commission can alter proposed boundaries if they do not like yours (whether you agree or not). They altered our boundaries to include the County airport, which was nearly double of what we were asking. This led to charges of a double-cross (that we were saying we wanted to incorporate X but really wanted to incorporate Y); this spelled the doom of the issue.\nI personally believe it is a worthwhile process, but my suggestions are:\n1) Take your time: Our process was rushed. The public must be educated and see this as beneficial to them.\n2) The Media: There must be an effective message. The media, if not an ally, must at least remain neutral. The media in Bellaire did not.\n3) Townships: They likely will not like this and the MTA has attorneys on retainer just to fight this issue. You can overcome this, but it will take some effort and it has to be viewed as not a significant threat to them but as a benefit to Village residents.\n4) Boundary Commission: Be prepared to jump through a lot of hoops. Make sure your boundaries make sense and include any reasonable areas that you are providing services outside of your current boundaries. Their reaction to your request can also play a big role in its ultimate success or failure.\nThere is more, so if you ever wish to discuss, please contact me at ercline@charter.net.\n\n\nThe Village of Bellaire (Antrim County) attempted this in 2000-2001.

  "text": "\n\nI am interested in hearing from administrators from villages that become/incorporated as cities or at least attempted this. I am interested in hearing what kind of experience it was and problems that occurred during the process. In the Village of Jonesville, we are in the exploratory stages of the process. There is a citizens committee who is looking into the process and is currently gauging the feelings of the public on this issue. If you have any information or insight on this, please contact me at: Services@Jonesville.org\nTim McLean\nVillage of Jonesville\nAssistant to the Village Manager\n\n",
