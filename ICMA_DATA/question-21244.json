  "text": "\n\nI am looking for any studies/guidelines that may be available which give ideal minimum parking space requirements for specific land uses. Additionally I\u2019m looking for any parking space requirement ordinances that base their standards on something other than building square footage, number of employees (total number or numbers of employees on maximum shift), or building/occupancy capacity.  I would prefer to have ordinances examples from municipalities the Midwest, but any example would be great.  \nThanks!\n\n",
