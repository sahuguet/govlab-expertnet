And in capturing that information, local governments can also review those processes and procedures to determine if there's overlap, duplication of effort, bottlenecks, or new ways to streamline things.\n\n\nOne of the reasons I'm a big proponent of CRM (constituent relationship management) systems is that the knowledgebase component of these systems allows local governments to capture the processes and procedures of how their service departments get things done.

CRM can also be used to manage key relationships as well, such as those with elected officials, regulators, or other government agencies. It's a great enabler of collaboration. Do you know of any local governments doing a good job of using CRM to capture and analyze their processes? I would be interested  in interviewing those involved with the policies and technology. I'm looking for case studies of technology enabled knowledge transfer. Thanks.\n\n\nCory, you make a great point about how to use the information a CRM system can yield.

Does anyonne familiar with public sector technology issues have any thoughts on this topic, or know any examples of counties or cities using technology in this manner? I hope to do phone interviews during October. Thanks.\n\n",
