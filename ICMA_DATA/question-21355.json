  "text": "\n\nHi,\nAs part of a review of our shared services governance model, I'm exploring the various ways that groups manage accountability.\nSLA's tend to come up as a tool for service delivery but what about oversight at a higher level? For example what responsibility does the HR group have for monitoring and reporting excessive overtime? What role does IT have if a department purchases software without approval that isn't in line with the IT strategic direction? \nI'd really enjoy hearing how other areas manage this type of challenge.\n\n",
