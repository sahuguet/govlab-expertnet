Unfortunately, we're a \"what have you done for me lately?\" culture that can't sit around and wait for the 3-5 year ROI that wellness programs offer, so when it comes to cutting budgets, those programs are usually on the chopping block and get the axe before they've had time to develop.  \nWe're just starting a wellness program in our organization and in our community, and I'd love to see some responses here from cities who have had wellness programs in place for 5+ years and can demonstrate the value that they bring to lowering long-term health care costs.  Thanks for the question, Alex.\n\n\nMaking changes to benefit plans (i.e. increasing deductibles, offering two or more plans for employees, increasing co-pays, etc.) have helped in the short-term for communities I've worked in, but employee wellness is the best long-term solution.

      "text": "\n\nHi Alex,\nWake County, North Carolina was nominated for ICMA's Strategic Leadership and Governance Award in 2010 for their wellness program. Their program incorporates onsite wellness programs with insurance-based health and wellness benefits. Some of their programs include lifestyle management classes, incentive-based annual health risk assessments and \u201cKnow Your Numbers\u201d screening, and onsite employee health services.  Not only did the number of prescriptions for cholesterol and anti-depressants drop, but after the first year there was only a 7% rate increase (as opposed to double digits in previous years) and a 4% increase the second year. Here is the link to the full nomination document:\nhttp://bit.ly/lJWECX\nHope this helps!\nAmanda Dodge\n\n\nHi Alex,\n\nWake County, North Carolina was nominated for ICMA's Strategic Leadership and Governance Award in 2010 for their wellness program.
