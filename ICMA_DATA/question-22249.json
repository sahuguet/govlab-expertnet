They earned (are earning) every penny we paid them.\nWe hired a local, one-man consultant to do our \"ground level\" project management that has worked well so far. The only advice I have in that area is to find someone detailed oriented and tenacious that keeps everyone in-line and on task.\nHope this helps.\nClancy Priest\nDirector of Technology (retired)\nCity of Hayward, CA\n\n\nJeffery,\n\nThe City of Hayward, CA is in the implementation stage of their ERP system.

We completed an RFP for consultant selection to assit with identifying, selecting and evaluating  vendors to demo their software. The consultant has also completed a gap analysis and developed an RFP for the final vendors to respond to.  This vendor RFP and Specifications document has been reviewed by an attorney that has experience with software company contracts. We are in the process of releasing that RFP this week. Once finalized I can email you all the documents for your reference.\n\n\nDoug:\nWe are small community of 17,690 population and are in the midst of evaluating vendors to provide an ERP software solution.

We did all the soup to nuts, Budget, Performance Management, Financial, Accounting, HR, Payroll, Timekeeping, Purchasing and Inventory.  We hired Plante Moran as the consultant to help us write the RFP, evaluate the bids, develop ROI, and assist in initial project management.  Mesa has an fully staffed PMO, but we did hire a Senior Project Manager to lead this effort exclusively.  The effort has been underway for close to four years, from initial hiring and staffing of the PMO and consultant, to our anticipated completion in Jan 2013.  I'd be happy to come by and discuss with you, as I live in Goodyear (Estrella).\n\n\nJeffery, \nMesa is 3/4 complete with our ERP implementation program.
