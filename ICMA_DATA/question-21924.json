  "text": "\n\nI am a young local government professional with six years of Management Analysis experience, and I just got my first \"significant\" job as an Administrative Services Director for a city.  I am changing states for this move and am trying to decide what to do with my house, which we purchased in 2006 at the peak of the market.  I've been trying to avoid short selling the house; figuring that the hit it would take to my credit would negatively impact prospects for future City Management jobs.  But I will be losing $600 a month renting it out.  My questions are:  1) is it considered \"unethical\" for prospective city managers to short sell their homes in such circumstances, and 2) am I right that short selling my home might hurt my prospects for future opportunities in this profession?\n\n",
