  "text": "\n\nOur City has historically contracted with an independent IT agent over the past ten years.  I do not believe we ever went out for bid for his services, nor do we have an agreement.  That being said, over the past three months, our relationship with our existing IT contractor has begun to devolve.  Staff members have been consistently approaching me about his poor response time and incomplete solutions.  I too have found that I have had to manage service requests and follow ups to an unacceptable degree.  That being said, we are going to pursue an alternative temporary contract with another service provider for the next year.  I  will likely look to move toward the solution by mid-late November.  I am unsure how to move forward with a scope of services, but I do know I want an agent who has the ability to drive a vision.  Specific projects include  looking for a partner to assist in managing the development of our fiber network project, helping us standardize hardware & software purchasing, developing and incorporating security standards, completing software installs, assisting us in our migration to MS 365 and migrating our existing Exchange mailbox to this new 365 virtual environment.\nAre there any communities who have shared a similar experience? \nAre there any sample RFPs that someone can point me to that may help me articulate our specs.  Our community size is apx 20,000, we are an inner ring suburb of Detroit.\nThanks for any input or advice,\n-Joe\n\n",
