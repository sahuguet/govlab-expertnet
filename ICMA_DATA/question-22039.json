While in both cases there was a budget department and the budget department had considerable leadership in budget preparation, the department commissioners were also given significant participation opportunities.  Both the city and county were governed by elected chief executives who would set down broad parameters at the start of the budget preparation process as to the year's goals.  With both the city and county, there was an executive leadership team which included senior staff of the County Executive and the Mayor as well as the Budget Director, Corporate Counsel, Finance Director.  Each Department Director was given at least two opportunities during the process to meet with the executive team to present the department's vision and needs for their budget with considerable give and take.  They also met at least twice the budget department staff.  In both city and county cases, obviously the budget preparation is a labor intensive process but it resulted in annual budgets with considerable buy-in and support from departments.\n\n\nI have been part of senior management teams for a large county government and a medium size city with similar experiences.

Do they help make budget decisions, review individual budgets, look at both short and long term budget issues, etc?  Or does their involvement remain at the big picture level, strategic rather than operational?\nThanks!\n\n",
