Rather than a council survey, employee surveys may return a greater return on investment if executed properly, including appropriate follow-up.\nAs you may know, surveys are great for gleaning insights and opinions from large groups of people and/or those that might be reluctant to discuss thoughts or opinions amidst their peers and colleagues, particularly where concerns about threats to employment might be perceived, e.g., employee surveys. That written, it doesn't seem that city councils generally fit either category as their opionions and concerns may be best addressed directly in one-on-one, where appropriate, and group discussions.\nCastle Rock is a great place, but I guess you know that. :)\n\n\nHi, Kristin.\n\nIt seems that the citizen survey results accompanied by staff analysis should generally be sufficiently supportive of a council goal-setting sessions without the necessity of a council survey also being conducted.

  "text": "\n\nThe Town of Castle Rock is planning a citizen survey this year. As a companion to that process, we're also interested in conducting a Council survey -- likely by asking for feedback on a range of issues on a Likert scale. Data collected via both surveys would be used for strategic planning purposes.\nWe're wondering if anyone has conducted a similar survey for their council/other elected board and, if so, if you'd please share your information. Thanks!\n\n",
