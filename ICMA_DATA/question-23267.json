Since public safety has several different schedules and geographically distributed workplaces the remote integration served us well.\n\n\nVictor, I would have to echo Mark's comments.

      "text": "\n\nVictor, Chesterfield County Fire and EMS, Chesterfield, VA has used the Telestaff system for several years prior to Kronos purchasing this system.  It has worked very well for our department.  Our operational staff works 24 on/48 off.  We also use the system for our traditional schedule daytime staff.  We track all leave, overtime, unit staffing, including volunteer staffing hours through this system.    When the county implemented a new payroll system (IFAS) we were able to have a bridge designed to allow our Telestaff to populate the county system, so it has become our payroll system.  Our success led to the purchase of this system for our Police and Sheriff's offices as well.  Very versatile system.  Our leave and overtime practices are very complex and we are able to manage it through Telestaff.  We also have a bridge between Telestaff and our Fire/EMS reporting software (Imagetrend) which autopopulates personnel into the fire and patient care reports.  This is very beneficial for the purposes of exposure reporting.\n\n\nVictor, Chesterfield County Fire and EMS, Chesterfield, VA has used the Telestaff system for several years prior to Kronos purchasing this system.

  "text": "\n\nCurious what digital timekeeping software solutions municipalities have identified and currently use.  Be it Kronos, Lawson or another company. We are looking for a solution that may integrate with a time in attendance time clock and possibly be web enabled that employees could enter remotely.  Any information you can share, including any bid documents would be greatly appreciated.  Additionally any information on how your chosen solution works with your Public Works and Public Safety departments and their difficult schedules.  \nThank you in advance for your assistance!\n\n",
