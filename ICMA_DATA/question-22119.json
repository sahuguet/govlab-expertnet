  "text": "\n\nOver 50% of the City of Tracy's bad debt write off is associated with renters leaving a bill at home they are renting even though renters represent about 25% of our customer base.   We currently allow individually metered accounts (i.e. a single family home) to be put in the name of the renter rather than the landlord. \nHas any other juristiction dealt with the same issue?  If so, what were some of your solutions?  Our Council's direction is NOT to restrict accounts to only landlords and in the last FY, we increased the deposit amounts for renters.  Any and all assitance is appreciated!\n\n",
