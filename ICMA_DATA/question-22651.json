  "text": "\n\nSeveral years ago our municipality passed an ordinance that required residents to change their existing water meter to a smart meter.  Recently, several residents have asked for an opt-out clause.  Does anyone charge the resident for not wanting to have a radio read meter?  Also, do you require them to have the meter outside?  Your comments are much appreciated.\n\n",
