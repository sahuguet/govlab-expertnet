There are some interesting articles and documents in the Career Resources topic you might look at as well (one example, chat with the managers of nearby communities to get a sense of the issues).  Lastly, you will need to be able to assure the hiring committee that you can serve the council and community as the manager, and assure them you can leave your elected official hat behind (as tempting as trying to 'second' a motion might be).

      "text": "\n\nMr. Thompson \u2013 although my experience in the public sector is relatively limited, I believe you already have a few things working for you.  The fact that you served as an elected official should assist you with landing an executive position with a jurisdiction.  At this time, you know how politicians think and what they are motivated by; this can only help when dealing with a group of subordinate managers who become disconnected from the political complexities chief executives must account for.  Due to your experience, you should have a good understanding of what policies to bring to your Council (and or Board) and how the politics of the item may play out.  Moreover, your experience with timing, and knowing when controversial topics should be expedited or delayed should be of assistance.  \nThe only piece of advice I have for you is to understand the amount of work/time/energy it takes for staff members to complete tasks and to create policies and programs.  In my experience, elected officials are somewhat disconnected from the day-to-day work of many employees and may not have a detailed understanding of what it takes to accomplish such tasks.  By being sympathetic to this, you may obtain support from staff and or the hiring committee sooner in the process.  Just a few thoughts and good luck!\n\n\nMr. Thompson \u2013 although my experience in the public sector is relatively limited, I believe you already have a few things working for you.

My undergraduate degree is Civil Engineering and I do have my license in PA and Indiana.  I went back to grad school part time and obtained an MBA and Masters in Public and International Affairs. With over 13 years in the private sector and 7 years serving on council I thought I'd be hired easily.  I found out it was tough to break into this sector.  Either council members did not like the fact I was a member of council (and thus could be political) or that I never actually served as a municipal manager somewhere.\nAfter 10 or so failed attempts, I accepted a position as an Assistant Borough Manager (and took a very hefty 50% reduction from my engineer's salary).  I was only an Assistant Manager for less than a year when the Manager's position opened up and I was appointed.  \nAfter five years I am back up to a salary I was making when I switched careers from Engineering to Municipal Management and have loved every minute of it.  (although quite a bit has been eye opening.  i.e. I hope I wasn't that bad as a council member.  I don't think i was.  )\nSo, if you are able to sacrifice salary in order to get your feet in \"the door\", that may work out best.  You are definitely called to this profession.  (now when I do hiring, I tend to give more attention to those coming from the private sector for obvious reasons.)\nBest of luck!\n\n\nI actually went through the same thing over 5 years ago.

  "text": "\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time on the council. So much so, I want to transition from Chief Elected Official to Chief Administrative Officer.\nIn addition to the four years I served on the council, I am currently serving in the government sector as a member of the Workforce Investment Board of Directors directing $11.6 million in public funds for job training of dislocated workers, youth, and veterans. I have a Master of Business Administration degree and more than nine years of experience in the private sector in supply chain management. In my last position I managed commodities totaling more than $56 million in annualized procurements.\nI am perusing several local government association websites for vacant positions and applying for those positions in which i have interests.\nAny suggestions on how to step up my game plan to improve my chances of making the transitions?\n\n",
