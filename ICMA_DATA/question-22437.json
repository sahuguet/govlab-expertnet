Original plans were prepared by Team Pain, however, due to financial constraints a revised plan was prepared by The Blue Stone Group (Columbus, OH) and approved by City Council for $500,000.  The revision involved replacing a large spine ramp with an 8 ft. deep kidney shaped bowl. Background info and pics are attached.  The facility has been a home run for the city attracting skaters from all over the country at beginning to advanced skill levels.  Bikers, in-line and boarders share the use equally.  The metal coping on all edges has been the key to a multi-use facility.  Upkeep and maintenance has been minimal and the facility is still in good condition.\nAllen Rothermel\nAssistant City Manager\nDelaware, OH\n740-203-1802\n\n\nAlex\nThe City of Delaware, OH constructed a 13,000 sq. ft multi-use (boards, boots, bikes) facility in 2006.

Specifically, I am looking for design and policy examples. Can any of you share any information that could be helpful? \nCordially, \nAlex Carmichael, MPA\n\n",
