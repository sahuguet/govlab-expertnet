  "text": "\n\nHello, \nI am looking for any examples of a county serving as webmaster  and/or hosting agent for a municipal web site. This could entail hosting the municipal website on county servers and/or arranging for county webmaster to create and modify the municipal web site template (or even the content).  I am trying to determine if there are municipalities that have partnered with counties in order to take advantage of economies of scale and save costs. \nThank you.\n\n",
