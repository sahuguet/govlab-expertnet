  "text": "\n\nThe City of Tacoma has an internal shop providing graphic and printing services.  We're considering alternatives to the service, including eliminating it. In our analysis of the alternatives, we'd like to include information from others who have printing and graphics services as an in-house function, information from those who have eliminated the service, and some of the reasoning for including it/not including it as an internal service. I have a set of questions for your consideration as an attachment. Thanks...Mary Morrison\n\n",
