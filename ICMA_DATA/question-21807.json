I'm leaving a county manager position I've held for about 18 years, so I haven't started with a new organization for quite some time.   I'm also moving from a large organization (1500 employees) to a smaller one (150 employees)  I'd really appreciate any advice anyone has for what do you do when you first walk into an organization as the new manager.   Any tips of what to do?  What not to do?  What should be my plan for the first few weeks, or few months to help insure getting off on the right foot. \nthanks,\nFrank Lancaster\nLarimer County, Co County manager/ soon to be Town of Estes Park, CO Town Administrator.\n\n",
