  "text": "\n\nI work for the Department of Local Government in Western Australia. Currently we are undertaking a review of our Standards Panel, which acts to investigate allegations of breach of conduct by members of various local government authorities.\nAs part of the review, we are looking into similar panels/committees in other jurisdictions, specifically the UK and the US. However, I have been struggling to find any information about whether a similar committee or panel exists at any level of government within the US. \nAt this stage I am mostly interested in city/county level.  \nAny direction into this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nnb - I have included a link below  as a point of reference for the equivalent in the UK.\nhttp://www.standardsforengland.gov.uk\n\n",
