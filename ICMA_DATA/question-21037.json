Initially the use of QR Codes in the City was introduced to the community through the City\u2019s quarterly publication, the Tam-A-Gram, where they link to more information, additional features, etc.  The City also uses QR Codes at various city facilities, specifically at parks and park facilities (i.e.: skate park, dog park, fitness center, community center, etc.) as a way for users to access more information (hours of operation, description of facility, etc.). We also use QR Codes where some of our public art is located \u2013 these codes provide a description about the artwork and artist.\nThere is not a specific policy regarding QR Codes, but the Public Information Office is responsible for creating, tracking, and maintaining them. All QR Codes must be requested through, and approved by, the Public Information Office.\nLinks for examples:\nwww.tamarac.org/publications\nhttp://cityoftamaracnews.blogspot.com/2011/01/scan-explore-qr-codes-around-city.html\nIf you have furhter questions you can contact our Public Information Specialist at chad.quinn@tamarac.org.\n\n\nThe City of Tamarac, FL began using QR Codes in December 2010.

At this time, the technology is only being used by our Community Outreach Division and our Economic Development Division. When we create a QR Code, we make sure that it is able to be tracked. We use the Google URL Builder, then a free QR Code maker. So far, we've been able to track the success of our magazine ads, airport ads, City newsletters, and City brochures. It has proven to be an invaluable tool in tying our print media to our website.\nUnfortunately, we are not using Microsoft Tags. Our City Attorney's Office had issues with Microsoft's terms of service. Being in the Sunshine State, we have extensive open record laws.\nI am the Conference Committee chair for the upcoming Florida Government Communicators Association's annual 2011 Conference. The conference theme is \"Get Your Geek On\" and will focus on the way in which our communication landscape has truly changed. Check it out at http://www.fgca.org/GetYourGeekOn. We are booking some incredible speakers to tackle subjects like QR codes, mobile apps, augmented reality, and other communication tools.\n\n\nThe City of North Port, Florida has been using QR Codes extensively for the last eight months.
