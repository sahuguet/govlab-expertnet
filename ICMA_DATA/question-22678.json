The city I worked for in CA provided cards with the same phone number (that went to the supporting staff person for elected, and each B & C) and a generic email that went to a \u201cjoint box\u201d that the supporting staff monitored.  To my knowledge is it was successful and provided elected officials and B & C members with a resource to identify themselves in the community while monitored by staff.\nPam\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Office\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\nwww.transformgov.org\n\n\nHi Jessica - I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever heard of a city/county that doesn\u2019t provide business cards for elected officials, Board & Commission members.
