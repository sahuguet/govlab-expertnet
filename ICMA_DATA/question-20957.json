      "text": "\n\nHi Patrick, \nI have been able to locate a few documents and resources that will hopefully be able to answer your question. A good  reserouce that has gotten good reviews from ICMA members is a re-designed publication called Leading Your Community: A Guidle for Local Elected Leaders. http://bookstore.icma.org/Leading_Your_Community_A_Guid_P1860C9.cfm?UserID=5871612&jsessionid=4e308dba28961a5e6a15 \nAlso, there have been a few previously asked questions on the Knowledge Network with similar topics. On January 28, 2011 there was a question asked about orientation packets for newly elected officials. Although it is not the same as a training program, it seems like it would be useful information in the program you create. In the answers posted there are a variety of sample packets for you to review: \nhttp://bit.ly/fdAyFF \nAdditionally, there was a question asked September 9, 2010 regarding goal setting instruments. The individual asking the question was looking for an exercise to send to her council before their retreat to help them develop goals for the upcoming year.  In the answers to the question there are a number of vendor names, templates, and attached documents: \nhttp://bit.ly/g6hQtL \nThe final applicable question was asked on August 11, 2010 and was looking for council team building consultants and examples of agendas used by cities in their own team building meetings. Despite there being no links or documents attached to the answer, the individual giving the response seemed pleased with the services she received and seems willing to discuss them: \nhttp://bit.ly/eAt2LS \nIn terms of documents, I have been able to locate two that seem useful. The first one is a Public Management publication called \u201cPreparing Councils for Their Work.\u201d The document describes some ways the manager can facilitate the building of council capacity, and since you are an ICMA member you should have full access to the downloadable article. \nhttp://bit.ly/e94Ryo \nFinally, there was a case study done that was published in a 2006 article called \u201cHow Do I Get New Council Members Up to Speed?\u201d In the article, three practitioners share their practices of how to brief newly elected councilmembers on their responsibilities.  \nhttp://bit.ly/ievQv5 \nI hope this helps! \nAmanda Dodge \nInternational City/County Management Association \nKnowledge Network Intern \n202-962-3699 \nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Patrick, \n\nI have been able to locate a few documents and resources that will hopefully be able to answer your question.

  "text": "\n\nIn preparation for the arrival of four new members to our City Council, we are considering holding a training session on goal setting, collaboration, decorum, and possibly a little group dynamics.  If you have done something similar previously, please consider sharing the name of the person/firm with me.  We may put out a quick RFP, but I would like to have a listing of good firms.  \nThank you in advance for the help.\n\n",
