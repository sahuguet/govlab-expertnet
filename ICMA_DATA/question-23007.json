      "text": "\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the origination site for shared educational access channel in Dubuque, Iowa, moved from the local cable company to a local university.  This move had been some years in the making.\nDubuque, Iowa, sits on the Mississippi River at the intersection of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin.  With a population of 58,000, Dubuque is the metropolitan service area for seven surrounding counties.  Much of the city lies beneath the bluffs that tower over the river.  This topography, coupled with the absence of local TV stations (the network affiliates for ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX are located more than 60 miles away in Cedar Rapids and Waterloo) has made Dubuque reliant on cable television to receive television signals.  This is Community Antenna Television (CATV) as it was originally intended.\nDubuque's first cable franchise went into effect in 1954.  A twenty-year franchise agreement was signed in 1981.  It was extended to negotiate a fifteen-year franchise with Mediacom, current cable provider, which was signed in 2005.  Dubuque has five public, educational, and governmental (PEG) access channels:  one for the City, two public access channels, a channel for the public schools, and a shared educational channel.\nThe 2005 franchise stipulated that Mediacom would originate the two public access channels and the shared educational channel as well as provide studio and facilities for the public and local non-profits to create programming for the community.  Looking to the future, it also required Mediacom to provide the necessary fiber in order to make one of Dubuque's local colleges an access origination site.\nDubuque is home to four small colleges, the University of Dubuque, Clarke University, Loras College, and Northeast Iowa Community College.  Loras College has a strong Media Studies program and has won numerous awards over the years for its student productions, most of which have run on the shared educational channel.  The director of that program has been very active in the local access community and discussed having Loras College run the shared educational channel with the City's Cable Franchise Administrator during the negotiations leading up to the 2005 franchise agreement.  Both thought it was a good idea, but the college was not at the point where it could take on the challenge.\nBy the summer of 2009 Loras College was ready for the assignment and discussions began in earnest to build a control room and transfer the operations from the cable company.  The City and Loras signed a ten-year agreement, and in the fall of 2010 the change occurred.  It should be noted that Loras does not provide equipment or facilities for local educators, it receives finished programs, and encodes and schedules them.\nAs we near the completion of the fourth year of this arrangement, I believe it has been very beneficial for the community.  Loras has a live cable channel for a laboratory in which students can learn about the operation of a channel that runs 24/7.  Loras also can more easily run its live weekly newscast and better manage the on-air flights of the programs it produces.  The cable company's production staff has one less channel to oversee, freeing them up for other tasks.  Loras has used its connections to encourage the other colleges to produce programming from which the whole community benefits.  The City is very glad to have another PEG channel operated by an entity other than the cable company.  Mediacom has taken advantage of a 2007 state franchise law and no longer is required to provide any PEG operational support.  It has agreed to continue operating the two public access channels as long as relations between the City and Mediacom remain cordial.\nCraig Nowack\nCable Television Coordinator\ncnowack@cityofdubuque.org\n\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the origination site for shared educational access channel in Dubuque, Iowa, moved from the local cable company to a local university.
