I think I found a guidebook that you could pull some tools from and adapt them to your needs. \nhttp://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/304019\nAlso, the ICMA Center for Management Strategies has a couple of free organizational self-assessment tools. You can check those out here:\nhttp://icma.org/en/results/management_strategies/resources/assessment_tools\nI hope this helps you out.\nJesse Himes, Knowledge Network Intern, jhimes@icma.org\n\n\nHi Barbara,\nThanks for the great question.

      "text": "\n\nThanks for your help, Jesse, I agree that I might be able to adapt some of the information... My focus is on evaluation of specific programs rather than on individual or organizational performance.  For example if we have a program to teach teen parents to read to their children, how do we measure its effectiveness or whether the benefits outweigh the costs?  How do we determine if our museum education programs are successful?  Our senior yoga classes?  I'd like to put together an adaptable framework that could be modified for the particular programs and desired outcomes and I'm curious if anyone has already done something like this.\n\n\nThanks for your help, Jesse, I agree that I might be able to adapt some of the information...

  "text": "\n\nEvaluation of programs and activities is necessary to determine if they are meeting the stated needs and/or having the desired outcome.  We would like to develop a framework to periodically evaluate our recreation, museum, senior, and library programs (among others), and we would like to know if anybody has a good methodology for doing so.  What data is collected for evaluation?  What is the criteria for determining success?  What entities are involved (e.g. advisory boards) in determining whether programs go, stay, or are changed?  An objective, systematic evaluation methodology will also allow us to more easily phase in new programs while operating in a constrained resource environment that assumes any new programs are offset by program eliminations.  Your input is much appreciated!\n\n",
