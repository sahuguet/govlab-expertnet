  "text": "\n\nIn a mid size city like ours (26,500) how do you view the role of the manager/administrator in relation to the planning staff? I inherited what was basically a new department which put planning, engineering, zoning, and inspections under one roof. I have found that the director has no role really. I anticipate that it is part of my job to lead development initiatives and projects like the CIP. We contracted with our local COG to work on our new comprehensive plan. The director is not a poor employee, but I feel that I need to reduce the position to strictly back office planning and zoning code administration. I would be interested to hear how it works in other mid sized cities. Thank you.\n\n",
