  "text": "\n\nHi everyone,\nRecently, we had a union employee announce his retirement. We are using this as an opportunity to restructure our streets/fleets division and want to replace the union position with a non-union management position. \nDoes anyone know what communication is required to do this, specifically between the union representative and the city? Has anyone gone through something similar?  We don't have anything specific in our labor agreement about this.\nThanks,\nJackie\n\n",
