      "text": "\n\nWe are currently considering moving to either a smaller sedan (likely the Impala) or SUV (between Tahoe and Explorer).  On state contract, the Impala is about 20K, and the SUV's are about 25K for Police versions.  Upfit costs are roughly the same, but the SUV's need another cage in the rear.  I would be very interested in seeing any research anyone has done on this issue.  Some issues we are considering are the obvious public perception question, as well as liability/safety issues associated with citizen transport in the rear of the lower riding and smaller newer sedans versus the larger SUVs, as well as potential workers' comp issues for removing and placing these folks in the back of the two very different platforms.\n\n\nWe are currently considering moving to either a smaller sedan (likely the Impala) or SUV (between Tahoe and Explorer).

With people tending to be a bit larger these days, it is quite a challenge to put someone who is 250 pounds and intoxicated in the back seat of the small sedans.  I thing it is important for whoever makes the decision to purchase, first sits in the back seat with the shield in place and imagine trying to get a large, less than pleasant person inside.  We are using Tahoes and that's the best option for us thus far.\n\n\nThe small sedans are not feasible for police work when you make an arrest.
