We use our Project Accounting system to track hours and bill back charges.\nThe general approach is like this:\nTotal FTE Hours (usually 2080)\nLess leave time (sick, vacation, etc)\nLess at work, but non-billable (meetings, training, unaccounted)\n= Estimated billable hours\ncharge rate =  ( budgeted: Salaries & Benefits + materials/Supplies/Other expenses + central services + other internal \"overhead) / billable hours. \nObviously, this is the generalized approach, but if an engineer works 4 hours on a project at a rate of $125/hr, the project is billed $500. Doesn't matter what it is for. The same approach could be appled to any governmental unit. The requiremenst is that the methodology be consistently applied across the work unit.\nOverall the operations revenue covers their costs. We use an internal services fund to run the operation as an enterprise.\n\n\nOur Public Works department uses a fee-for-service model for costing activities.
