I led one with the City of Tisbury, MA to identify issues that could help them be more efficient, look at how they were using their facilities, evaluating technology use, and so on.  We had all the department heads meet with and without management to walk through this process.  It was very useful.  This information could then be used as the basis for a broader meeting with the larger community interest groups selected to participate in an integrated planning exercise that looks at the same service(s) and creates a vision, mission statement, service expectation and what can be done differently under a privatized strategy that can't be done internally.  Many times you find ways to fix what you have that offsets the need to privatize.  Sometimes the results justify the need to move forward.\nBill Gilmore\nWilliam B.
