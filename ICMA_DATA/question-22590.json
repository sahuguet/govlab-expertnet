      "text": "\n\nHi Lillian,\nThere is also a great program for identifying and developing leadership competencies among staff by a company by the name of Lominger/Korn Ferry.  This model has been utilized by the City of Dublin, Ohio, and others, very successfully and points to both the types of competencies that can propel an employee forward in their career as well as several that are \"career stoppers.\"  If used in the development/refinement of position descriptions or training, I think you would find this approach very interesting and useful.\nIf you would like to learn more, I can put you in touch with one of the service providers in the Center for Management Strategies who is certified in the Lominger program.  They would be happy to share some additional information with you.\nThanks for your inquiry to the Knowledge Network and please let us know if we can assist you further.  You may also want to look at the webpage for the Center for Management Strategies at http://icma.org/en/results/management_strategies/home  and check out our High Performance Organization leading practice area or our CMS Blog at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/blogs/blog/50/Center_for_Management_Strategies \nor our CMS Group at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/groups/kn/group/1302\nThese are good places to outreach to people with questions regarding organizational development too!\nGood luck Lillian!

Has anybody done this work in your city? (i.e. what trainings each level should take to be successful?) If you would be willing to share with us, we would be very appreciative!\n\n",
