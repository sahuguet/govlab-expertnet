  "text": "\n\nI am applying for appointment as a judge to the Superior Court of California in the county where the County Executive Officer works.  I have asked her to recommend me to the Governor, but she is of the opinion that the Code of Ethics which forbids political activity for elected officials bars her from this endorsement.\nIn California judges are typically appointed, but subsequently every 6 years must run for office.  When there is an open seat, and no judge has been appointed to fill out a term, there can be a contested election.  In my case, this would be an appointment until the retiring judge's term expires, in three years, and thereupon there could be a contested election.  \nDoes the Code of Ethics forbid an endorsement to the Governor for this appointment?\n\n",
