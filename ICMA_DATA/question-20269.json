I can share that it has given us insight into future fiscal problems and it has provided us the time to begin addressing those issues.  When I got to Edmond 4 years ago I questioned the value of the 5 year plan.  I am strong advocate for it now based on the information it has provided for long range fiscal planning.\n\n\nEdmond, OK has done a 5 year budget projection for a number of years.

      "text": "\n\nYears ago we looked into this in Multnomah County in Oregon. While the hope was that the time saved in the \"off year\" would be devoted to more intense planning effort in preparation for the \"on year\" of budget-making, we concluded that we were going to have to \"tweak\" the 2nd year's budget, resulting in much of the same effort as we were undergoing in the single year budget cycles. So we figured we were going to do the same amount of budget development and still needed to figure out how to devote more organizational time and energy to \"planning\" efforts. I believe we need to stop forcing the budget development cycle to act as the de facto planning cycle -- separate the two efforts, let budget follow planning and de-emphasize the budget effort a bit. I've long felt what you end up doing in budget-making is extremely incremental -- and sometimes you need more aggressive change. \nThe other considerations involve the election cycle of your public officials. If a two-year budget development cycle doesn't provide newly elected officials a chance to make budget changes for an entire year after they are elected, I have found they get frustrated about carrying out their election platforms. So you need to consider that in creating a cycle. For us, this again argued that the \"off year\" would invariably end up being a much more intensive \"revisiting\" of the decisions made the prior year . . . negating the \"saving\" we would hope for in moving to a 2-year cycle. \nLong story -- it didn't feel like we would change much, so we didn't.\n\n\nYears ago we looked into this in Multnomah County in Oregon.

      "text": "\n\nI've worked in State government where we had a biennial budget, but on the off-year we'd release the Midterm Budget Adjustments.  Long story short, it was an annual budget, but we called one the Biennial and the other the Midterm.  A rose by any other name is still a rose.  Invariably you go through the same process of gathering up department requests, recalibrating your personnel costs, searching for places to shift funds to make room for new initiatives or cuts... it's great in theory but in practice government is far too married to an annual budget process to make anything else work differently.  \nI also don't see how you can break away from incrementalism... in the northeast government doesn't have the freedom to resize and restructure every year especially with the union atmosphere here, so the personnel budget (the majority of your $$) is 95% locked up right off the bat... then most other major expenses are ongoing program expenses that are tied right in with the personnel, or overhead expenses you can't get away from... so I question whether government even has the freedom to do anything truly resembling zero-base budgeting.  And I tend to think there is only a small minority of programs you could even consider expanding or eliminating... as most town gov functions are either essential services (public safety, public works, etc) or they're something people would like to see remain in its present form.\n\n\nI've worked in State government where we had a biennial budget, but on the off-year we'd release the Midterm Budget Adjustments.
