  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for trail naming processes, policies or procedures used by other counties.  Douglas County, Nevada has a non-profit group that does much of our trail development.  For the most part trails have gotten geographical, historical, or private parties names if easements are granted.  This has worked well.  We are getting ready to involve the community in a process to name a significant loop trail around the entire valley.  I'm interested in the ways other jurisdictions arrive at names for segment and substantial trails.\n\n",
