The second is to counsel the mayor that new staff and other perks have budgetary consequences, that any modifications to the budget will require the approval of the council and that before proceeding to direct the drafting of  legislation the Mayor should determine if a majority of the council will support these changes.\nIt is not uncommon for new Mayors, particularly in Council-Manager Cities, not to appreciate the role of the Council.\n\n\nThis is not an unusual request as many newly elected officials' perceptions of their role and perks are based on big city and/or ficitional accounts.

However, you would be more then pleased to put the proposal together and place it on the Agenda for City council consideration.  In the end if the Council supports the plan, your stuck and it is after all their call.

  "text": "\n\nGood Morning:\nWe have a new Mayor (NOT directly elected) and a fairly new City Manager.  This new Mayor has indicted he/she wants a full time staff office and other \"perks\" that normally are not provided to Council or Mayors in the past.  Does anyone have thoughts and ideas about how to manage this so that it does not become the City Manager's (and staff's) full time job to appease only the Mayor? \nThanks!\n\n",
