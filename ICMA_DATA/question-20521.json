The evaluation of those behaviors should only be compared to established standards (developed through a job analysis), not to behaviors/performance of other employees.  The individual either performs at the standard or above or below and should be rated as such. As Barry mentions, the key to successful performance evaluations is education for the evaluators - they need to fully understand the performance standards and how to compare their observations against the standards, and then be honest about what they observe.  I'm trying really hard to think of the benefits of utilizing a bell curve system. You mention it was successful in driving expectations - I would suggest that is established through performance standards and goal setting.  I recently completed a project on a new performance evaluation system, I would be happy to discuss further if you are interested.\n\n\nA performance evaluation system should be focused on behaviors, as behaviors drive results.

You will see that I started with some analysis to demonstrated a need to make changes (70% of all employees rated exceptional). 2) A revised proposal that focused on some minimal PMP system revisions (personally, I don't like the way this system is designed and if I had my way, we would utilize an entirely different system; however, we are working with what we have so as not to spend more money). 3) A proposal/outline of a training program.  I welcome any additional comments/questions - I obviously have a lot of interest in this topic! \nDerek - I'm not sure these are appropriate for posting in the Knowledge Network, but once you take a look we could speak further about it. \nLynn\n\n\nWell, I did find some documents to share: 1) The original proposal to redesign our performance management system.

We have been doing so for four years (and it has worked to drive expectations) and now find that with layoffs and other reorganizations that it may be time to move to something else - like a semi bell curve.  I am interested in feedback from others as to the use of the bell curve, results and any transformational next steps?\n\n",
