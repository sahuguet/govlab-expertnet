What I had to learn was that most people are not going to come out of an MPA program and go directly into a job as a manager/assistant manager, unless they also have prior applicable real-world experience.  What I know NOW is that there are good reasons for that.  When I had been in the public management sector for 8 years, I finally realized the advice I'd gotten for years was right...the best way for me to get the budgetary and supervisory experience necessary to become ready for city management was to take a position as the director of a municipal service department.  In the time I held that job, I developed the skills and knowledge I once THOUGHT I already had.  Then, when the administrator position I now hold came along, I could truthfully tell the hiring Council that I had both the academic and experiential background they were seeking in an administrator.  \n   I will also advise that, if you are unwilling/unable to put in a few years in a mid-management position to gain that experience, and being a manager TODAY is the only route you'll accept, you have to be willing to seek jobs in smaller, probably more rural areas where the salaries may not be as high.  You'll get GREAT experience quickly, and that's the trade-off for the difference in compensation. As a current participant in the Emerging Leaders Program, I encourage your participation in that as well.\n\n\nI certainly understand the frustration several have expressed here on this topic.

For example, my first job asked for 2-3 years experience (assistant manager) and I had a year at a strong internship where I could easily demonstrate that I could handle the responsibilities.  My current job (Township Manager) asked for 5-7 years, but my 3 years of strong experience as an Assistant Manager qualified me.  \nMy advice is to go above and beyond in your internship or other work experience and try to amass the skills you know you will need on the job.  Develop a portfolio of your work and prove that you are up to the job.  Then, research the job well- call and ask if they would consider someone with high quality experience gained in a shorter time span.  It also helps if you're willing to work for less.  Be creative in how you're marketing yourself. \nI also got involved in the Next Generation initiatives through ICMA- both the LGMF program and the Emerging Leaders program- which have been excellent ways to show prospective employers that I'm qualified and capable.\n\n\nAlthough many jobs ask for 2-3 years experience, if you have strong internship or other work experience, they will often allow for it to substitute.

In this economy they can get quite a bang for their buck rather than help develop an aspiring career manager.

This is horrible for the future of municipal management, but I don't know that the elected officials responsible for hiring know or care (the old \"let someone else do it, we want the best for ourselves\") what the future may look like if they don't hire next generation managers, providing us experience, now.\nAs for me, I have given up the search for a manager position and have instead taken an analyst position with the state.  I'll re-evaluate in a few years but in the meantime it's some meaningful work, relevant experience, and network-building.\n\n\nFrom my own experience, many village/city/township councils aren't \"on board\" with next generation initiatives.
