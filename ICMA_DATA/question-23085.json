We build our leases so they increase by CPI on an annual basis.  All leases are for 5 years with an automatic 5-year extension.  In some cases, we have also built landscape maintenance fees into the leases, and will manage the landscape contracts for sites that the lessees have a hard time keeping up to standards.\nI have attached our department policy document, circa 2003, which may be somewhat relevant.  For us, the key with siting these facilities is that we would much rather see them within the right of way or attached to a structure, than located within a park.  While the revenue is nice, maintaining the overall appearance and usability of our parks is paramount.\nYou may want to check with local utilities providers (i.e. owners of water towers), since they will often be some of the first structures to have antennas attached.  That will at least get you started on establishing market rate.  My recommendation is to not turn to the providers to help you set market rate: we found that they were displeased that we began charging market rate, and were more used to telling people how much they would pay for the facilities.  One of the sites, which we inherited from another agency during a property transfer, saw a ~500% annual rate increase when we began charging the provider market rates for land.\nAside from local utilities, I'd start with whichever appraisers you use to determine property value for acquisitions.  They should at least be able to get you pointed in the right direction.\nColin Walker\nBellevue Parks & Community Services\nBellevue, WA\n\n\nSeveral years ago (10+), we did a market-rate study for the area and determined cell site pricing.

In addition to the advice you have so far received, I'd like to suggest that you consider including services from the lessee in addition to rental payments as compensation for use of your property or structures.  Having sufficient wireless broadband service without paying market prices is certainly worth considering.  You can't be too careful in making sure that the language of the agreement is clear and that sufficient detail is included.  These agreements should be flexible to suit your needs for the next decade or two as technology continues to evolve quickly.  I am recently retired, but you can email me for the appropriate contact information with the last community I served in West Michigan.   homanrc@sbcglobal.net\n\n\nMr. Casias, \nI had several opportunities to negotiate space rental agreements with wireless phone service providers and others, space on our organization's water towers being the principal commodity being sought.
