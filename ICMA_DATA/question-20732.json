      "text": "\n\nCheol, \nThere are many resources to measure various forms of domestic political corruption if one looks long enough. I can recommend two non-profit organizations that are dedicated to promoting transparency within government and rooting out corruption.  \nhttp://sunlightfoundation.com/ \nThe Sunlight Foundation: They lobby lawmakers for increased transparency, fight to release important public documents and make them available online, and track political contributions that individual politicians make. They're worth checking out. \nhttp://www.citizensforethics.org/ \nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW): CREW conducts research, files Freedom of Information Act requests to make public documents surrounding most of the major issues of the day, files ethics complaints against lawmakers suspected of ethical wrongdoing and investigates and combats unfair and unethical conduct within all branches and levels of government.  \nBoth of these organizations are non-profit, nonpartisan organizations with long track records of vigorously confronting corruption regardless of who is in power. They're both as good a starting point as you're likely to find.  Good luck.\n\n\nCheol, \n\nThere are many resources to measure various forms of domestic political corruption if one looks long enough.
