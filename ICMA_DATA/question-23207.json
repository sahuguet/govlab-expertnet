  "text": "\n\nThe City of Walnut Creek, California is currently going through an audit by the IRS regarding the use of independent contract instructors for our arts and recreation classes.  \nMy question is, do you know of any other agencies that have previously been audited (or that are working through one now, as we are)?   We are seeking to learn as much as we can about the experience and how to be successful in our approach to the situation.\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\n",
