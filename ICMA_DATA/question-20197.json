This is their effort to ensure better compliance rates with the sign ordinances.  Perhaps this could be a cost-effective way of enforcing the code while not incurring the costs of posting signs outside for your local government as well?\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Jerene:\n\nI have looked into this fairly carefully, and have as of yet been unable to find any local government that offers exactly what you mention (advertising provided as part of the registration process), but I did find the following, which comes close:\n\nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/100447/City_offers_free_online_garage_sale_advertising\nIn this article, we are told that the city of Stayton OR has recently implemented a policy where a household applies through the registration process to hold a garage or yard sale, and then the city provides them free online garage sale advertising space.
