      "text": "\n\nJohn,\nI just received a quote for a program from Nixle.  If you're not familiar with Nixle, they offer an emergency mass notification system via cell phone text messaging and email.  The notification service is free to emergency service related government agencies.  We've been using them for a few years, and the residents love it.  Their \"tips\" software, along with mass landline phone dialing (reverse 911) is where they make their money.   They're nationally recognized as a leader in their field.\nOther then Nixle, I've also reviewed Max's suggestion, TipSoft.  They've been around for awhile, and seem very reputable.\nIf you have any questions about Nixle, you're more than welcome to email or call me.\nGood Luck \nMitchell\n\n\nJohn,\n\nI just received a quote for a program from Nixle.
