      "text": "\n\nHi Judith: \nIn speaking with staff here at ICMA, we have survey data and research about citizen boards in general, but not the specific issue you are interested in; concerns of diversity on those boards. \nThat said, I can definitely point you to several resources as starting points.  You might start with the2005 release from the National League of Cities, on the topic of Inclusive Communities.  It has the suggestion of starting the process of encouraging more diversity through those appointed positions on boards, with city council members actively seeking to appoint citizens from a variety of backgrounds as signaling the overall intention to have more diverse volunteerism for the boards.  This document can be found at  http://www.nlc.org/ASSETS/AA4DEFABD4F9489D897985AB6C66D016/o5futuresrprt.pdf \nThere is also the 2006 release from the National League of Cities, which is about the overall topic of Inclusive Communities.  Within it, you\u2019ll find several interesting ideas on how to approach this, such as the mention of a Residents with Disabilities Advisory Board, and how it won awards for necessitating residents of all backgrounds within its membership.  This is available at  http://www.nlc.org/ASSETS/03428E6E381C4D5889CF3FDAF8952980/inclusivecommunitiestoolkit06.pdf \nFinally, another resource might be the following city policy, from San Francisco.  This policy sets out the possibility of ensuring better and more inclusive diversity on city boards and commissions, and you can check it out at  http://sweetmelissa.typepad.com/sweet_melissa/files/prop_d.pdf \nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Judith: \nIn speaking with staff here at ICMA, we have survey data and research about citizen boards in general, but not the specific issue you are interested in; concerns of diversity on those boards. \n\nThat said, I can definitely point you to several resources as starting points.
