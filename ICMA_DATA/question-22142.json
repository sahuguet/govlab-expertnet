Are you interested in elected local leaders? or professional local managers?  ICMA has been conducting city to city partnerships for more than 15 years and find it one of the most successful ways to build capacity and enable positive change in communities.

Can anyone recommend best practices / lessons learned around city leaders peer-to-peer learning? And, do you think a resource like this might be useful?\n\n",
