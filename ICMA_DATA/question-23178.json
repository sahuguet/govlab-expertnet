  "text": "\n\nThe City of Barron is located in the geographic center of Barron County and has a beautiful park with a river transecting the park.  A coalition of; City of Barron, County of Barron, individuals and local Civic Clubs are working to install a pedestrian bridge across the river in the City Park.  This pedestrian bridge needs to be, at minimum 105ft in length, with a preferred width of 6ft.    \nMy question is this;  can you help me please in how we can secure the needed bridge without having to spend \"big-bucks\".  Would anyone have something that could work?  We currently have a bridge about 50ft in length, does anyone have an extra bridge?  Ideas on how to construct a bridge economically?  If you had a bridge in pieces, in the correct length, we possibly would have transportation to move it to Barron.\nPlease respond to jeff.french@co.barron.wi.us, or 715-537-6840.\nTHANK-YOU!! for any help you can provide!!\n\n",
