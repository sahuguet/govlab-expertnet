  "text": "\n\nThis is a re-posting from Decemer 2010...  The Tempe Center for the Arts (Tempe, Ariz. - municipally owned & operated), now a bit more than three years in operation, is fortunate to have a group of residents who have come together to create a 501(c)(3) non profit  organization to support/benefit the center. Currently, leaders are meeting and defining parameters of the partnership. \nI am seeking information/conversation regarding roles and responsibilities of similar organizations. For example: What role does the support organization play in the overall operation of the center? What is the extent of financial support offered by the organization? What is the extent of staff support offered by the center to the support organization? What measures are in place to delineate responsibilities of each party?\nMany thanks, in advance,\nDon Fassinger\nTempe Center for the Arts\n\n",
