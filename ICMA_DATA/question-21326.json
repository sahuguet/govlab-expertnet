A full structure fire response within 15 minutes 90% of the time.  This is a recommendation as the decision rest with the local authority. It seems like this is expensive for many departments and the industry standard seems to be 3 on an engine.  NFPA - http://nfpa.com/AboutNFPA/AboutNFPA_Overview.asp\nI have attached an excellent report from NIST on crew size that is worth reading to answer your question.  http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=904607\nHope this helps.\n\n\nNFPA 1710 sets the standard for fire department response.

      "text": "\n\nNFPA 1710 is based on the assumption that firefighters are responding to uncontrolled fires. With nothing else to stop such fires from growing, fire departments must have several apparatus near enough to a structure to \"surround and drown\" aht fire, as they say.\nThe standard does not consider the fact that sprinkler-controlled fires cut the demand on firefighters and apparatus by 50 percent or more. Also, sprinkler-controlled fires significantly reduce life and property loss, even when stations are more spread out and response times are longer than those in 1710.\nFire sprinkler requirements are a good risk management tool. They can make communities safer and fire department more affordable.
