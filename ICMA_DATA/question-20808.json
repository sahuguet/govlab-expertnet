Most local governments use in-person orientations for a variety of good reasons (new employees can meet, shake hands and speak with the colleagues they'll be working with, as well as get an up, close and personal look at how the bureaucratic process works). \nAre you just looking for orientation documents online? A lot of those can be found on ICMA's Orientation Topic Page. \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/186/Orientation\nFrom the wording of your question, it sounds like you might be looking for something more than that. If you can provide a little more detail, I'll see if there's any resources in the Knowledge Network or ICMA at-large that might be helpful.\n\n\nHi David,\n\nI suppose that depends on what your definition of \"online orientation\" is.
