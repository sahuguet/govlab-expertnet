Here's what she sent me:\nThe one at GW is really good--I know several people who did it and liked it. I'm not totally sure, but there are programs that are like graduate degrees, and some that are shorter training programs. If you're interested in a graduate degree, GW and UMD are among the few programs. Otherwise, you can look into courses at the Emergency Management Institute (http://www.training.fema.gov/EMI/). There may be more info about other programs on that website.\nFor more information about Emergency Management, you can also check out the topic page here on the Knowledge Network:\nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/79/Emergency_Management\nI hope this helps to answer your question. Please let us know if we can be of any more help.\nMax Moline\nKnowledge Network Intern\nICMA\n\n\nHello Jared, \n\nI posed your question to a contact who works in emergency management.
