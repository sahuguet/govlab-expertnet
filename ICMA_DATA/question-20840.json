  "text": "\n\nI am currently reviewing and upgrading my Department's Business Continuity Plan.  Internal Services Department provides Computer/Data, Purchasing, Building Maintenance, and Support Services such as Mail/Messenger, Automotive Fleet and printing services to departments in Los Angeles County.  Although we are not a \"First Responder\" during an emergency/disaster - we are a Lead Department. We will need to stay in business to assist the \"First Responder\" departments.  I would like to review \"Business Continuity Plans\" in other government agencies who provide services similar to ISD.\n\n",
