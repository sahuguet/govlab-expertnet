  "text": "\n\nIn 2010, when Charlotte County was preparing a new comprehensive plan, we worked with the University of Central Florida (UCF) on an online platform for posting our draft documents for public review; part of the software developed for this purpose by the UCF computer lab (\"PICT\") involved the ability for citizens to comment on specific sections of the draft documents, for those comments to be moderated, and subsequently displayed next to the draft section they pertained to.  Staff could then respond in the same format to the comment, and other public comment could accrue on the same subject.  The PICT software was recognized nationally an a unique contribution to the citizen-comment process.\nA document currently online in this software environment can be found here:\nhttp://www2.charlottefl.com/CharterReview/main/about.aspx?message_id=Documents \nFor various technical reasons, the software is not now useful (this may have to do with Microsoft Windows updates over the intervening years) and we are looking for any similar software solution to once again put pending legislation (our zoning code) before the public for comment.\nWe are soliciting suggestions for software options from the group, and all replies will be welcome.\n\n",
