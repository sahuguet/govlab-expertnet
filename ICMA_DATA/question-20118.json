We currently have a Performance Management Team that has been instrumental in developing our perfromance management system.  Much in line with Thomas' comment, we too have realized the important in keeping performance results at the forefront of the departments.  With that, our City Manager just announced to Department Heads that they will now be responsible for reporting on performance once a month as part of our Department Head or Senior Leadership Team Meetings.  They will be responsible for reporting results on key measures identified on their department's respective Balanced Scorecards.  They will be expected to provide information on actual performance and how it compares to both the previous month and the previous year's period.  In addition, action plans are required to address any undesirable trends.  Performance Management Team members will be present at this time as well to assist Department Heads in their presentation.  I have attached an example of one department's Balanced Scorecard.  The Scorecard's are regularly accessible to Performance Management Team members as well as Department Heads.  The interactive scorecard allows them to drill down and further analyze any one of the measures and provide narratives to support performance trends.\nI am certainly interested in how you frame your approach and interested in any feedback anyone has to offer.\nAs a side note, our City Manager currently has our Leadership Team reading The Price of Government by David Osborne and Peter Hutchinson.  I haven't finished it just yet, but the theme seems to be centered upon using performance management as a method to become a results-oriented organization, holding leadership accountable to performance and so much more.  Quite honestly, I believe this book is where our City Manager is getting most of his ideas for the transition I described above.  The book provides great examples and may be a good resource if you have not read it.\nGood Luck and keep us posted on your progress!!\n\n\nLeslie\n\nThe City of Collinsville, IL is also beginning to lay the foundation for which we report performance.

This is what the City of Cartersville is striving towards, and to me, is the most challenging aspect of any performance management effort.\nWhile we do not currently have a system in place to meet and review performance  measures and results, we have started reporting on select performance measures on a monthly basis.  The performance measures are included in a \"dashboard report\" which is distributed to all department heads, the city manager, and soon the council will receive a version as well.  While I don't feel that there is a strong coordinated review process built in at this time, the groundwork is being laid for that process.  Eventually, we hope to set goals based off of the benchmark data that we are now collecting on a monthly basis.  \nThe benefits that I believe this system has provided are 1) keeping performance measurement at the forefront of department's attention since they report monthly rather than annually, 2) providing detailed performance benchmarks on a monthly scale, and 3) the accountability and transparency inherent in reporting.\nI'm very interested to see what strategies other jurisdictions are using to actively review departmental performance.

Departments initially developed strategic business plans that divided their work into programs. Each program has a budget and performance measures. Departments revise their plans on a yearly basis. They regularly collect data, and then report out to our Performance Plus Executive Team (PPET) on a quarterly basis (even though they may be collecting data on a monthly basis). PPET consists of our city manager, 3 deputy city managers, the CFO and deputy director of Finance, and three rotating directors/upper level management. The department has 25 minutes to give their report and do a Q&A. Since time is limited, we've asked that they only focus on the measures that aren't meeting their targets. I've attached an example of the report. We are also working on Web streaming the meetings so that any city employee could watch. If an employee has comments or questions, they could ask their director.\nMaggie Plaster\n\n\nHi Leslie,\n\nThe city of Las Vegas started a Managing for Results initiative in early 2007.
