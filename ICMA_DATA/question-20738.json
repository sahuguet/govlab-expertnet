They may know about some resources that may be helpful to you. \nCenter for Performance Measurement \nhttp://icma.org/en/results/center_for_performance_measurement/home\ncpmmail@icma.org\n202-289-4262\nIn addition, I have attached to this answer a study done by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation regarding nine municipalities in Iowa that experimented with \"citizen initiated performance assessments\" (CIPA) in 2001. Based on how helpful the study is, it may be worth following up with the foundation or the individual cities and towns involved in the study to see if the program is still active and how useful they found it. Contact Dr. Paul Coates at 515-294-1844 or paulc@iastate.edu. \nI would also check out this page of their website, as it seems to contain examples and contact information for a few other citizen-based performance measurement studies: \nhttp://www.seagov.org/sea_gasb_project/sloan.shtml\nHope this was helpful. Good luck with your search.\n\n\nHi Leslie, \n\nI would recommend contacting someone at ICMA's Center for Performance Measurement.

  "text": "\n\nCity Council has asked that staff convene a group of citizens to revew the City's scorecards and performance measures before we make them public.  We have been working on these for many years now and this is kind of the final push.  Has anyone else done something similar and have any suggestions on how to make this as useful and successful as possible?  \nThanks!\nLeslie Beauregard\n\n",
