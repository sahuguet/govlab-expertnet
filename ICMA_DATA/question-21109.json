That is where things like Google Analytics can help you a  lot. But that data needs to be compared against a base - that base is the existing level of non-web contacts.\nIf you know how many citizen contact phone calls come in, and how many walkups come in per day, then you can rationally look at your daily web traffic and you may find it already is significant.\nI think we as professionals need to understand that there is a qualitative difference in \"customer\" related traffic from more participatory \"Public Engagement\". I think that the Public Engagement piece is a far more difficult issue, than redirecting customer traffic.\n\n\nI think  a major question is \"what IS significant use?\"\n\nWe know people come to look for jobs, the hit counts verify that.
