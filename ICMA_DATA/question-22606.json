I think there is likely a long list of answers to this question on many levels but let me focus on a few key points that I think local governments can employ on a practical level to help increase civility.  \n-Ensuring that the public at large feels comfortable participating in a discussion is really important. In a polarized heated debate those moderate voices can shy away from conflict, which is what you do not want to happen. Moderate voices really do moderate the debate by encouraging people of varying opinion to participate in a debate. \nFurther, people are really smart and many will seek out the opinions of others in a forum before forming their own opinion. So, on a basic level, before a local government institutes a discussion they should set guidelines for civility, or the ground rules for discussion, at the outset.  \nOpen Town Hall, an online civic engagement platform used by many local governments works to create 'guidelines for civility' to inform participants of the ground rules before they contribute to an open and transparent discussion.  \n-Another key point connected to the last is to address profanity, personal attacks, and other unsavory comments when they occur. Open Town Hall has a mechanism for reviewing each comment on a forum and reconciles 'uncivil' behaviour in a non-confrontational way without limiting free speech. We've managed to get the 'uncivil' comment rate down to .02% and half of those comments are simply 'off-topic'. Those guidelines for civility head most off at the pass!  \n-Much of the vitriol and bullying found on public forums come from anonymous individuals. Preventing anonymous comments in a forum sponsored by a local government really does a lot to improve the integrity of the comments and create a true public discussion. \n-Last but not least, people make the best decisions and form the best opinions when they have all of the information. This can level the playing field and create an atmosphere of empowerment and trust. Civil dialogue and open data are really important here. \n-Of course, there are many other ways to increase civility between opposing factions and it would be great to see some more listed by other members with other backgrounds.
