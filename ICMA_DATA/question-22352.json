With recent shootings, the identification of risk has been faced with a new front -- terrorism against responders.\nThe United Kingdom and its fire brigades have done considerable work in the area of risk reduction. I would point to Merseyside Fire District as but one example of an outstanding Integrated Risk Management Plan centered around a thorough review of the risks in the community. In addition to identifying the risks, the brigade has sought to mitigate those risks which resulted in double digit improvements in fire loss as well as injury and death from fire.  Risk identification and management is mandated across the United Kingdom and fire chiefs can be held liable for failing to appropriately quantify risks when deploying resources.\nThe group \"Vision 20/20\" has been meeting for a number of years in the United States and has pioneered the concept of \"Community Risk Reduction.\" Their website can be viewed at: \nhttp://www.strategicfire.org/\nThere is an existing Powerpoint presentation that has been prepared and which will be expanded upon in an ICMA Webinar program.\nLastly, the Center for Public Safety Excellence, Inc.

We started to work not only with staffing problem but from a global and strategical view. Just an exemple to let you understand: water is extinguishing fire by the fact the heat let it rise in temp, then evaporate (change state from liquid to gaz). In order to have a good effect, you must have a large \"contact surface \"between water and heat. If you calculate the surface of a solid bore for 1 gallon of water and the surface ot the same gallon, flowed with a fog nozzle producting very small dropplets, you'll see the surface with dropplets is about 25 times greater. That's what we say a solid bore as an efficiency of only 20%. This mean than the team, flowing 1000 gallons with a solide bore will, in reality use only 200 to kill the fire. The other 800 will fall down and do nothing. The problem is easy to understand: depending on the way my firefighters work and the nozzle they have, in order to flow 200 gallons of \"usefull water\", I must have a 1000 gallons truck (case of solide bore at 20% of efficiency) or only a 250 gallons trucs (case of a fog nozzle with 80% of efficiency). Price of the truck is not the same, need of gasoline is different, insurrance, size of the truck (garage size) and so on...\nAlso, if the only solution I know is to increase flow rate to compensante the poor efficiency of the my nozzle, I need bigger pump, bigger hose line, so heavy equipement, so much more people and so on.\nWe are writting our study on that, but we see that, trying to take one part of the problem without the other, is very easy but never give a good solution. Firefighting is fire, men, tools and technics. All are linked.\nActually, the conclusion we have with our second document is that we will fight fire with two trucks: a fast small truck with about 250 gallons of watrer and a team of four. As we perform also first aid and we have ambulance with team of 4, we can use the same team. Immediatly after the start of the little fire truck, we start a \"tank\" of about 2500 gallons, with 3 guys: the driver and a binomial who will be the second of the little fire truck.\nThis works because we know (german study) that 85% of fires need less than 250 gallons of water. But, what we know also is that, to be able to fight 92% of fire (so only 7% more!) we need more than 2500 gallons.\nBut (and that's a key point), our guys don't use US method but European one, using far more less water, so being able to reduce size of equipement, size of trucks, pump and so on. \nYou can see an example of the result on www.tantad.com an article in English, titled \"Good Job!\" give a view of this way of doing.\nBest regards\nPierre-Louis\n\n\nHi,\nI'm from France, but now linving in Brasil and we are working and creation of \"Volunter Fire service\" so we are exactly on this way of doing.

Unless Motorola begins making a crystal ball, this is a difficult task to conduct.  I've always found that a lot of future growth potential changes before any real construction begins.  Generally a risk analysis (assuming we're talking primarily fire/EMS) should follow the information set forth by the Center for Public Safety Excellence in their standard of cover document.  This model includes an assessment of historical risk frequency, potential loss, building inventory, etc.  After analyzing risk, determining deployment needs is easy with some basic GIS modeling.  NFPA 1710 is the perfect document to help craft your response plan for future areas (how many stations will I need to get 15 firefighters on scene in ten minutes).  I can send our risk assessment to you via email if you'd like.  Good luck!\n\n\nChief Boulware:  You mention in your post that this effort is being undertaken to plan for future growth.
