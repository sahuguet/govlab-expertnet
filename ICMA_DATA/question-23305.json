This has made news across the state of NC.  While I don't work for that County, I thought it may be worth sharing.  It may be worth trying to contact them.

  "text": "\n\nIn our municipality we have quite a few people who are close to, or already eligible for, retirement.  Our management is thinking about the possibility of offering early/retirement incentives in order to be able to put new people into place.  We have some key positions in mind and we\u2019d like to know if other municipalities or public entities have implemented such a program and if it has been targeted or more widespread.  What was the outcome and participation level?  Our HR department has concerns about doing this with respect to perceived unfair compensation... if that was a concern for your organization, how did you overcome it?\n\n",
