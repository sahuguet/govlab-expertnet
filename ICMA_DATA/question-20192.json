It's a fairground complex, know as The Ranch, and does include an events center about the same size, the Budweiser Events Center.  We jointly manage the site with county staff and with a contract with Global Spectrum and we've been very happy with the arrangement.  For more info, you can contact the Director of The Ranch, Bob Herrfeldt.  Bherrfeldt@larimer.org.\n\n\nThe Loveland Facility is owned by Larimer County.

      "text": "\n\nEvery organization has to clearly define City, community and facility goals before making a decision on public or private management. For Civic Center Music Hall, in Oklahoma City, the public model has proven very successful. Our primary facility includes three theatres and two ballrooms. Fixed seating varies from 100 to 2,500. We have five large resident arts organizations that include symphony, ballet, choral, national touring Broadway and regional theatre. Additionally we have two community theatre organizations that utilize our smaller theatres. \nThe Civic Center Music Hall model has been so effective, that we also  operate as a management company over a college theatre facility, with one 1400 seat theatre,  and a 501c3 facility with two theatres and a reception space. Combined, we hosted over 1700 events in the three facilities for FY 2009/2010.\nBeing both a municipally operated facility and a management company, it is easy to speak about the advantages. The best example are college facilities designed for public events. Their primary purpose is to educate students and their staff experience doesn\u2019t include managing  public facilities. Even with theatre departments, they may not have the promoter contacts or multiple level of theatre experience required for hosting major touring events. Not for profit arts organizations have limited staff and budgets which limits their ability to manage public facilities. We provide both these organizations overall management that includes centralized event scheduling, annual budgets, monthly reporting, annual capital improvement needs, preventive maintenance programs, box office services, professional staff,  and additional events from established clients. Both organizations have annually renewed management agreements. The advantages are it secures events and visitors to their facilities, they have minimal staffing expenses, a predefined annual budget, credibility because of the Civic Center Music Hall organization and revenue streams to offset expenses. Simultaneously Civic Center Music Hall generates revenue to offset their annual expenses. \nBased on this information, I firmly believe experienced City employees can provide superior services at substantial savings to the annual government budgets. The only way this is successful is if they are allowed to operate under a not for profit business or enterprise model that has clearly defined performance goals. This is the same way private Management companies operate, except you have to add their profit to the annual budgeted expenses. The Civic Center Music Hall is an annually subsidized model that provides lower rental rates to resident companies which improves the quality of life for their citizens and promotes economic development.\nI hope this helps and don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if I can be of additional assistance. \nJim Brown\njim.brown@okc.gov\n\n\nEvery organization has to clearly define City, community and facility goals before making a decision on public or private management.

  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for resources related to the management of an Event Center owned by a municipality.  The facility seats approximately 10,000 people and is used for a variety of events; sports, concerts, trade shows, etc.  The facility is currently operated by a third-party management firm.  We are trying to decide what the best management options might be moving forward (switch management companies, bring the management \"in house\").  I would very much appreciate any information that might be provided related to handling the transition (private to private or private to public), governance (municipality setting up some type of management entity), and other related items.\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
