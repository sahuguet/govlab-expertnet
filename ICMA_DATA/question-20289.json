Motor vehicle fatalities are a rare occurrence in the Borough resulting in fatalities.  However, Roadside Memorials have been placed at the sites where the fatal accidents occurred.  That being the case, we think it is appropriate to establish a policy regarding temporary roadside memorials.   A temporary roadside memorial would be one that consists of flowers, flags or other lightweight ornaments or objects.  The Borough would permit these memorials in the public right-of-way or on Borough property for a period of six (6) months provided they do not block sight distance for the traveling public, interfere with or obstruct any traffic control device or interfere with any necessary work in the public right-of-way.  The intent of the six month period is to provide an opportunity for family and friends to grieve their loss.   At the end of the six month period, the Borough would attempt to notify those placing the temporary memorial, giving them an opportunity to remove the memorial prior to it being removed by the Borough Highway Department.  \nThis policy will implemented immediately by the Borough Manager\u2019s office unless Council directs otherwise.   031708\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE POLICY ON ROADSIDE MEMORIALS -  As a result of many fatalities that occur on the nation\u2019s highways, Roadside Memorials will occur by which friends and loved ones choose to commemorate the deceased individuals and to honor their memories by placing some type of memorial object or display near the spot where they died.

I think our take on it is that such events are so rare, it's really left to the Board's discretion and doesn't warrant a policy.  But I'd be interested to see if any other towns do have such a policy in place.\n\n\nInteresting question... we just had a very high-casualty workplace shooting just last week in town, and we do not have such a policy because typically something like a homicide is a very private matter... but last week's events are altogether different from anything this town (and this state) has ever dealt with.
