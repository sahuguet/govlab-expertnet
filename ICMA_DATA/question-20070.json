All of this information is drawn from the Georgia Code (found here: http://www.lexis-nexis.com/hottopics/gacode/)\n1)  Per Title 36-Chapter 71-Section 1 of the Georgia Code, impact fees holds that \u201can equitable program for planning and financing public facilities needed to serve new growth and development is necessary in order to promote and accommodate orderly growth and development and to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the State of Georgia\u201d \u2013 this explicitly stipulates that the impact fees must be for the reduction of costs when financing new additions to public facilities, as opposed to paying upkeep on current facilities.\n2)  Per Title 36-Chapter 71-Section 2, the specific definition of \u2018capital improvements\u2019 \u201cmeans an improvement with a useful life of ten years or more, by new construction or other action, which increases the service capacity of a public facility.\u201d  Although your posted question does not mention specifically the intentions of the money, it seems phrased as though it is intended as a tax to assist with upkeep, as opposed to financing a capital improvement.\n3)  Finally, per Title 36-Chapter 71-Section 13, \u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit private agreements between property owners or developers and municipalities, counties, or other governmental entities in regard to the construction or installation of system improvements and providing for credits or reimbursements for system improvement costs incurred by a developer including interproject transfers of credits or providing for reimbursement for project improvement costs which are used or shared by more than one development project.\u201d   This clearly states that the law would not prohibit the partnership between the local government and the Park and Fly lot; this is academic, as it doesn\u2019t seem to involve a capital improvement, but for the purposes of clarity, there would be no prohibition of working with that private organization using said surcharge.\nHopefully this helps!\n\n\nHi Crandall:\n\nHaving looked specifically into the laws of the state of Georgia on this issue, I have found several facts that might be worth considering about the possibility of this being an issue of impact fees.

I'm thinking this amounts to an impact fee and will require a formal study and subsequent legislative action.  Does anyone else charge such a fee and, if so, what process did you go through?\n\n",
