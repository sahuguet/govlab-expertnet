  "text": "\n\nIs anyone aware of a specific city, county or region which, in the past couple of decades, has marketed itself to attract businesses by emphasizing its natural resources, such as abundant water supplies?  I'm not really concerned with the wonderful projects that some cities have undertaken to revitalize and market their waterfront districts nor with the resource of hydro-forces, so much as with the availabilty of plenty of water (or wind or easily developed real estate which is not vulnerable to natural disaster) - any resource which would have a general interest to many types of industries.  Obviously, a mining community could market to businesses relating to the resource being mined, but I'm looking for a broader spectrum than this.  Thoughts?  and thank you.\n\n",
