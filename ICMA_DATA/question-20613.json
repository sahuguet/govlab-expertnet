Some contact centers simply provide a referring phone number, others actually create a knowledge item if the question comes in frequently enough.  But it's your decision.\n311 is a simple, easy-to-remember number for constituents, which is probably the most compelling argument for using 311 directly.  That said, there are many jurisdictions that have established a contact center (it's more than phone calls...) using a dedicated 7-digit number.\n\n\nToni - You will likely get lots of calls about services that are outside your jurisdiction, but it's up to city leaders to determine how far they want to go in responding to those types of questions.

If you have a 311 system, are you responsible for providing information outside your corporate jurisdiction?  I have been told that we would have LATA-wide responsibilities, which go beyond our experitise, but I have not been able to confirm.\nOn a related note, are there distinct, compelling advantages for establishing \"311\" over a seven-digit number?  Thanks for any information.\n\n",
