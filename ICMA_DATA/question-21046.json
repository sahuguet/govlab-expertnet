This helps me become a partner to the program side of our organization to know what resources are available at any given time in our fiscal year.\nI know that I cannot be the only person who is in charge of finance that is already doing this, and who is a partner with program and the chief executive of the organization.\nAs with most GASB pronouncements, they are either already a best practice or in some cases, unneccessary as a formal you shall, but that is just my own opinion as someone who was on GFOA's special review committee for awarding the CAFR awards to entities across the United States.\n\n\nAlex, not to sound confused, but if your finance department was following a prudent and conservative approach, you would have already followed the intent of the GASB 54 pronouncement, and your finance staff or department would know to the hundreds of dollars what the outstanding fund balance is made up of.\n\nEspecially, in tight budget times, I know what my fund balance is comprised of on almost a weekly basis.

      "text": "\n\nAlex: \nGASB 54 addresses how to categorize fund balance. It facilitates comparisons across organizations, which is the nature of financial reporting. Compliance with GASB statements through adopted local policies may be unnecessary if state law already requires governments in a state to comply.  \nThe challenge for governments, when it comes to fund balance from a management perspective, is not just how to classify it but what is the appropriate level to maintain. That requires examination of the factors unique to each jurisdiction while also recognizing what rating agencies consider adequate levels. I have attached a best practice from GFOA and you can access additional information on fund balance through GFOA's web site. There is a new best practice on  Replenishing Fund Balance in the General Fund available there that will formally be adopted tomorrow at GFOA's business meeting.\n\n\nAlex: \n\nGASB 54 addresses how to categorize fund balance.
