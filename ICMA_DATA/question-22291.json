Dubuque suffered terribly in the 1980's (23% unemployment in 1982), but has since rebounded (3.7% unemployment now). In 1995 a new Comprehensive Plan was adopted (nothing to do with me, the process started before I came) and is now updated every 5 yers. In addition, the Mayor and City Council meet each year for a 2 day strategic planning/priority setting session. \nIn additon, in 2005 the Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque and the Dubuque Area Chamber of Commerce conducted a year long process they called Envision 2010. The asked the community what 10 things did they want to see accomplished by 2010.\nThe city, County and several smaller communities in the County are currently going through a comprehensive planning process.\nVisit our web-site at www.cityofdubuque.org.
