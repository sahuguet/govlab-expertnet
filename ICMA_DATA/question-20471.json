We actually did one or two every year so it was on a five or six year cycle to start over.  You could set it up on ten year cycle to reduce annual costs.  The world, technology, labor, and all the assumption of business activity can and does change sometimes  a lot in five years.  \nWhile these audits  were the city managers audit, I forged a partnership with the departments to be full participants in the audits developing the issues and questions the Departments wanted to look at as well as what I wanted to look at in the Departments.  The purpose of the audits were to see what circumstances and assumptions had changed, what new systems and technology were available, what best practices currently are in the industry and how to improve effectiveness and efficiency.  \nI went to great lengths to make sure these were not witch hunts, gotchas or a means to fire anyone.  I don't need an elaborate and costly report to fire someone I don't trust or believe in , I have lots of means to do that if appropriate.  What I did need was information on how to make the departments the best they could be within the available budget.\nThe draft audit was then fully reviewed by the manager and departments separately and together for finding any errors and for coming to agreement on what would be implemented from the audit report.  I find that about 80% of the consultants recommendations fit the internal and external needs of the city and some of those need fine tuning.  Remember, it is not the consultants report or consultants organization, its yours.  The consultants will tell you that themselves.  There are a number of reasons why all recommendations should not be implemented ranging from practicality, costs to politics, all real things in a public agency.\nThe goal is to continuously improve the departments and city's service to our citizens at the lowest costs possible.  An outside look will help bring new ideas and avoid losing opportunities do to inherent blinders from being to close to the issues.\n\n\nI conducted a Management Audit  review of every department about every five to six years.
