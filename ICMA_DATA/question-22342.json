  "text": "\n\nGenerally, in the past, the City has required the developer to pay for all infrastructure to serve their development including off-site and the City would pay for the oversizing difference of any line it identified as a major water and sewer main. Now, the City is considering some alternatives to this traditional approach to encourage some new residential and commercial development in an area in the community that has been identified as a potential growth area per the Comprehensive Plan. This stems from one property owner that wants to run a water line to their commercial property, but it does not play into the overall major development scheme for this area and does not benefit the long term development of the area and may hurt future growth. Also, the cost of land prices in this area has really made it difficult for developers to try to build and develop the area because it may take longer to get a return on the investment. So the City is considering installing a major water and sewer main that is identified in the master plan for this area and charging a pro rata fee for any new development. I wanted to get thoughts and opinions on any City that has taken a similar approach. I appreciate your help.\n\n",
