But much depends on your flexibility to relocate, the kind of place you'd like to work/live, and, when going for the manager's job, your chemistry with the local council.  I am seeing a lot more of what I've heard happened in the 1970s, which is recent or fresh-MPAs jumping right into manager jobs in smaller communities. There will likely be more opportunity there as the retirement wave grows.   \nBoth paths you mentioned can get you there. One risk with the department head path is getting stuck in one area of expertise if you're not aggressive enough with your career advancement (it can take a while, or you have to move on to move up). That's not insurmountable, but it's something to be aware of.    \nYou have a big advantage in that you have a good career behind you that will give you a leg up when pursuing CM positions in smaller governments. There's certainly no harm in exploring both routes - I think you have a good shot with either. \nNo matter which path you take, always be aware of the lifeline available in the ICMA network. It's lonely at the top, and without a support network this profession can burn out the unprepared.\n\n\nBrian -   \n\nI think both approaches are typical.

      "text": "\n\nBrian,\nI echo Robert\u2019s response.  Both approaches are common. I receive similar advice after graduate school also.  In my case I begin as a city manager intern in my community and transition from Public Works Director to CM.  I believe the exposure to a broad cross-section of issues is very valuable and smaller communities tend to offer that opportunity.  I believe you can be successful with either approach.  The most valuable input I found in preparing for the position was access and exposure to the expectations of the position.  I hope this helps.\n\n\nBrian,\nI echo Robert\u2019s response.

      "text": "\n\nBrian- I'm one of those 70's public mgrs who did 2 internships in Va/Wash DC while  a student and then began a series of moves in asst. and support roles in various local govs til I took the leap to Mgr in  small community in CT and Ive since continued CAO status in  4 other communities in a quasi upward mobility path. For me being a generalist with budget and overall organ perspective was more career enhancing than  a internal organ/Dept process. there are lots of opportunities in locxal government admin. like others have said aprticularly if while still \"young\" you have mobility optuion and family is willing to relocate and their jobs have other community options. Back in the day , our profession had a 3-5 yr life expectancy/ community and I fit that pattern until i got to County Gov here in WNY , 18 yrs later it has been the best move of my /our career. CAO qualities that employers are looking for still seem to be broad based budget, CIP and negotiating skills , good communication and writing ability, leadership and strategic planning/long range planning experience and community involvement. The internet and local government website give so much more advantage to candidates to discretely gain insight into a possible job before even submitting your resume/appl  vs the 70's/80's old style and odnt even get mne started on the cattle calls in the early 70's when the feds were ramping up HUD,H&HSand other fed pgms that geting a GS rating was the seeming be all and end all of. That's my 2 cents. good luck\n\n\nBrian- I'm one of those 70's public mgrs who did 2 internships in Va/Wash DC while  a student and then began a series of moves in asst. and support roles in various local govs til I took the leap to Mgr in  small community in CT and Ive since continued CAO status in  4 other communities in a quasi upward mobility path.

  "text": "\n\nCurrently an intern with the City Manager of Fairborn, OH and after talking to her about my desire to become a CM at some point, she suggested I find employment as a Village Administrator to get the experience of a CM with a smaller population. I was prepared to \"work my way through  the ranks\" taking on roles in smaller departments, but now I wonder if this approach is more of the norm.  As a soon to be graduate and at 39 years old, I'm not without my life's experiences so I feel like I have a little more to offer should a position like this open up.\nso I wanted to know if you all had any advice like that which was given to me?\n\n",
