Are you trying to develop an analytical tool for determining when each vehicle should be replaced? Or are you looking for a method to back charge departments for the operating costs of vehicles?  I'll be happy to provide you more details from my fleet management experience.  Feel free to email me at asabraham@aol.com if you wish.\n\n\nHi Noah, can you provide a little more information on what you are looking for?
