Any help you be appreciated.\nQuestion: I am attempting to find the regulations and requirements for an Environmental Health Director position. Currently our County has both a Health Officer and an Environmental Health Director. We are looking into the feasibility and legality of having the Health Officer oversee the Environmental Health function (and removing the Director). Can you point me to the regulations that would be applicable?\nNote: This individual is from California.\n\n",
