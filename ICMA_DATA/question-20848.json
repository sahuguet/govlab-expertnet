  "text": "\n\nThe Peninsula Strategic Issues Team made up of City of Charleston, SC personnel and chaired by the Police Chief is seeking information from your city or town on whether the presence of street performers is permitted or prohibited. If permitted, the committee would appreciate receiving additional details on business license requirements and how these performers\u2019 behavior is regulated with regard to solicitation as well as hours and permitted areas of operation.  \nConversely should street performance and solicitation be prohibited, we would appreciate learning how this was accomplished.\nPlease reply to griffins@charleston-sc.gov\nThank you very much.\n\n",
