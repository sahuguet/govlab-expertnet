  "text": "\n\nFor instance, if county govt. wants employees logging in to county and dept. Facebook, etc. do the employees create a \"professional\" or \"employee acct\" in which to engage with co-workers and the public?  If they are logging in with their personal accounts then their personal info is there for everyone to see.  According to Facebook's ULA - a person can not have more than 1 acct. although many people do.  I'm very interested in knowing how others are handling this issue.  Thanks for the info everyone!\n\n",
