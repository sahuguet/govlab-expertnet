      "text": "\n\nMike,\nThere's certainly a range of approaches on fleet and facilities.  Some jurisdictions focus on cost efficiency (per mechanic or custodian, per square foot, per vehicle, per mile, etc.).  Others look at minimizing repair/cleaning costs (e.g., through vehicle replacement criteria, preventive maintenance, choices of construction materials).  Regardless, ICMA recommends that such measures be supplemented by consideration of customer satisfaction, both on the quality and timeliness of service.\nFor some concrete examples of how jurisdictions are reporting their performance data, you can click  http://icma.org/en/results/center_for_performance_measurement/services_and_publications/certificate_program and review the \"Public Reporting\" links at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nMike,\n\nThere's certainly a range of approaches on fleet and facilities.
