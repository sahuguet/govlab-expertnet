During my final semester of graduate school I was fortunate enough to land an internship with the City of Troy, MI. I learned about planning, finance, human resources, and organizational development. If it hadnt been for this internship, I dont think it would have put me in the position to land my current position. I learned quickly that you can have all the education in the world, but it is no substitute for practical experience. Another highlight is if the internship is paid, to really sell that. As a grad student, finding a paid internship was like finding the winning lottery numbers. However, with the things I got to do in my internship, I would have taken it even if it was unpaid. My internship was for one year, but I had the option to come back for a second year.\n\n\nI think the most important thing to sell to MPA students is the invaluable experience they will learn while interning in local government.

In addition, I've had a fair amount of experience competing for national internships across the country over the last two years. \nI am a big supporter of the two-year program because it demonstrates committment to the intern. With just one year, you really spend too much time getting up to speed and then preparing for your exit and next step. I believe that both the intern and the City get more from a longer 2-year term. \nAs for naming, I really like the model that some of the very best programs use, like Long Beach, in calling it a Management Assistant program, which is what we've now done in Fort Collins. It's very substantive and gives the \"intern\" a little more to show both with co-workers during the year(s) as well as on his/her resume afterwards. Another great program, Tacoma, give a title promotion and small salary increase between the two years, which is another great way to show progression and get more out of your investment. \nAs far as appeal, yes, it definitely needs to be paid if you want the best and brightest out there because if not then another city/program will snatch those people up. I would also recommend advertising on ICMA and with top MPA programs in order to perform a competitive national recruitment.\nPlease feel free to have this manager friend of yours contact me - I've got plenty of ideas to share!\n\n\nHi Greg, I've given a lot of thought to this topic as I've helped design our own program here in Fort Collins.
