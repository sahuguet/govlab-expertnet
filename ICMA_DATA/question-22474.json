Encourage managers to conduct regularly scheduled weekly one-on-one meetings (approx. 30 minutes long) between the manager and each individual direct report.   I've been doing them for nearly four years and even with seven direct reports, it represents an extremely valuable and effective use of my time.  \n1. Provide venues for and encourage \"hotelling\", where employees whose primary office is in one facility can conduct work from another building. \n3. Equip staff with mobile technologies and access to information that make it easier to work from anywhere.   We've done this by shifting to Google Email/Apps and either providing smartphones or tablets or allowing employees to bring their own devices (BYOD). \nIn my experience, we've seen greater productivity and alignment within departments and greater cooperation across departments as a result of these actions.\n\n\nTo answer the member's question, I know of no municipality that has situated their key management staff this way.  \n\nIn my mind, the larger question suggested here is - how does a manager effectively communicate with their direct reports while ensuring that those managers and directors have effective and productive working relationships with the employees within their departments? \n\nHere are some of the ways we've attempted to address this issue: \n1.

It can adversely affect communications and the connectivity and credibility with the Department employees.  I see no reason that a City Manager needs a Department immediately adjacent at their beckon call.  This is especially true with email, smart phones and video calling.  I have found the once a week staff meeting and asking them ot come over when needed more then sufficient.\n\n\nThe primary job of the Director is to run the Department.

For example, the City Manager is considering moving all of the directors of each department into one building with him; while leaving some of the support staff in other locations.
