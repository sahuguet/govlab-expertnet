I do not know why you did not get it already, but what matters is that we get you one, and we will.  Also, I recall that you wanted information on financing for climate change adaptation projects.  I did get some information on that but I will have to dig it up again.  so you will get another communication from me soon.  Thank you very much for participating in the MFTC program.  I hope you found it worthwhile.\nBest Regards,\nSandra\n\n\nDear Rudolf,  I have confirmed that you indeed passed the exam.  I am working with GLDN and World Bank to get you a certificate.

I just want to make a clarification when I should receive it? Hoping to see your reply soon. Thank you\n\n",
