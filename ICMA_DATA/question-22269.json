  "text": "\n\nThe Town of Castle Rock contracts with community organizations for various services that it might otherwise provide itself. Examples include our Chamber for business programs and events; the local EDC for business attraction/retention; and the Senior Center for older adult services. (There are eight such contracts in total.)\nWe're struggling with how to best quantify the value of contracting with these organizations, rather than potentially providing these services via the Town. We also are seeking a better way to measure the performance of these organizations relative to the objectives stated in our contracts with them.\nWe would appreciate seeing examples of contracts/applications/performance assessments/etc. from any communities who feel they have a good handle on this. Thank you.\n\n",
