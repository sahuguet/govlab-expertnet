      "text": "\n\nThe concept is having one person responsible for all public safety issues. We need to look at delivery of public safety services as a system - not a series of independent, non-connected activities. This is particularly true in the post 9-11 world. (See attached PM Article). While fire fighting is indeed quite different than policing, the reality is that fire suppression activities constitute a tiny portion of most fire department's activities. Most fire departments today are medical delivery systems and we know that when the police are an integral part of that delivery system the outcomes are better. See, for example the attached PM Magazine article on Police and AEDs. In fact in many communities the police provide first responder EMS response (such as Tonawanda and North Castle New York). So, when various activities are provided across departmental lines it makes sense to have one person coordinating these activities.\nOf course in some communities, public safety officers are cross trained as police officers, fire fighters and EMS responders. Kalamazoo, Michigan and Sunnyvale, California are large city examples of long time successful public safety departments. And anyone who has flown into one of the New York airports has been protected by cross trained public safety personnel. The NY / NJ Port Authority police are actually public safety officers \u2013 trained as firefighters and police officers.\nEven when the police and fire departments operate as separate units, there is value in having one individual coordinating their activities. And, agencies are taking on new roles. See the attached PM article \u201cTale of Two Cities.\u201d In particular read about the success of Dr. Frank Straub in coordinating the fire and police activities in White Plains, New York. (Straub, by the way, is now public safety director in Indianapolis where he is responsible for managing all Police, Fire, EMS, Animal Control and Emergency Management activities). In Albany the fire fighters are also Code Enforcement Officers and the Building Department is a part of the Fire Department.\nFinally I would add to Tom\u2019s comments about bringing management skill to the emergency services systems. It clearly is not necessary to have been a police officer or fire fighter to be able to successfully manage a police or fire agency. What are required are strong administrative abilities and the capability to build a strong staff with the appropriate tactical skills. Far too often we have individuals leading police and fire agencies who are excellent tacticians and are great field officers but lack the experience or education or orientation to be managers.\n\n\nThe concept is having one person responsible for all public safety issues.

Also, \"Public Safety Director\" is somewhat a misnomer as it is....for example, in many County jurisdictions an \"Emergency Services Director\" is responsible for oversight of EMS, Emergency Management Operations Center, Fire Chief (Inspections, et al), 911/Communications, and coordination w/Volunteer Fire Departments.  That position is actually, if not more so a\"Public Safety Director\".\n\n\nYou are spot on Matt.

      "text": "\n\nThere are several answers to this question, depending on the structure of the local government.  A \"traditional\" public safety director would be responsible for 911, law enforcement, fire, EMS, and emergency management - sort of like a deputy manager position, to maintain reasonable span of control for the manager.  \nIn counties, law enforcement is usually the purview of an elected sheriff - which puts the public safety director out of the law enforcement business (and where the emergency services director title comes up).  In other states (NJ being one example), a \"chief\" is a sworn officer, police or fire, while a \"director\" is an unsworn position - you see communities there with all of the permutations and combinations.  \nI have to take a swat at the notion that there is much commonality between law enforcement and fire suppression - they are distinctly different professional disciplines with very little in common.  You can only subscribe to the \"one chief for both\" theory if you truly believe that a person can run a department with zero technical knowledge of the service it provides.  Manage, maybe - lead, certainly not.  Neither cops nor firefighters will follow a leader who has never earned professional credibility in the discipline.\n\n\nThere are several answers to this question, depending on the structure of the local government.

In cities where a police or fire chief report directly to a City Manager or Mayor they are generally not reporting to someone that has been in the police or fire ranks. A City Manager or Mayor will direct a Chief in operations as they deem necessary, although most operational decisions are made by the chief.
