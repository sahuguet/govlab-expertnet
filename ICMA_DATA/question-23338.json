Capital project management and administration was connected more tightly with the Office of Management and Budget and contracts management in the Purchasing department.

      "text": "\n\nMs. Watson - (ps: Hi Bob) \nGreat question. Answer: it depends on what you are trying to accomplish and why. Cost savings / efficiency? Improved Culture? Improve Service delivery?  \nWe have assisted in the re-organization of dozens of local governments and Public Works is always the most variable in terms of what works. There are three elements which need to be considered: Functions, Structure and Staffing - in that order. If you address one without the other...or out of order...you are asking for trouble. First, examine how various functions will fit together (or not). Second, consider how accountability for performance of those functions will be most efficient within various organizational alignments. Finally, examine how realignment of staffing (individual personnel and classifications) will affect salary grades and compensation. Note: more difficult with collective bargaining units.\nWith one city it made sense to bring Engineering under Public Works reducing one of 12 direct reports from the City Manager.  With another city, including Parks Maintenance 'department' in PW rather than its own stand alone local government. Some include PW 'over' enterprise funds and some cities have them separate. It depends on what your city's situation is and what it is trying to do. \nFeel free to give me a call. I can share 4-5 examples of how some of our clients re-org'd their PW dept. Could give you come good ideas. No cost...just happy to be helpful. \nDavid Evertsen, Principal\nMunicipal Solutions LLC\n623.207.1309\n\n\nMs. Watson - (ps: Hi Bob) \n\nGreat question.

  "text": "\n\nHow has your jurisdiction organized its public works, transportation, capital projects, facilities and engineering functions? Do you use a decentralized or centralized approach? What has your experience been with that type of structure? Do you a have large service department in these functional areas structured with a director and a deputy director? If so, what functions report to the director and what functions report to the deputy? What recommendations do you have for a jurisdiction that is exploring these questions?\nThank you!\nShannon Flanagan-Watson\nAssistant County Manager\nArlington, VA\n\n",
