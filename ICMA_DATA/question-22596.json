While an independent financial advisor can be of value it is not generally necessary.  As a first step, the community should reach out and have a conversation with the bond rating agency because in almost all cases the rating agency will be glad to explain their reasoning behind rating changes.  While the rating agencies will not necessarily tell a community specifically what can be done to restore a rating, the information that can be gleaned from such a discussion usually offers a clear path for an action plan to address the deficiencies that caused the rating drop.  Communities should also bear in mind that there is far more that goes into a rating agency's determination than the community government's finances but also includes an overview of the community as a whole both past, present, and projected future.\n\n\nBased on the info in the question, the drop in the bond rating is not necessarily because the industry never materialized but more likely because the community's budget process was counting on the industry's tax revenue and/or the community's growth projections were based on the arrival of the industry.
