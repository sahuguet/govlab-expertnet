If you are a non-exempt employee and work in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek, you will be paid either cash or compensatory time at a rate of time and one-half.  Compensatory time may, at the department director\u2019s discretion, be allowed to accumulate to forty (40) hours.  All accumulated compensatory time not taken at the end of the fiscal year will be paid.  Compensatory time may be used in increments of one-half hour.\nExempt employees are eligible to receive administrative time for excess hours worked.  The intent of administrative time is not to provide hour per hour time off, but rather to allow management the flexibility to recognize employees who work extra time to provide services.\"\nHope this helps.\n\n\nI am currently working on a handbook the following is what is says about overtime...\"4.6    OVERTIME & COMPENSATORY TIME\nAll employees are expected to work overtime when necessary.

OVERTIME AND COMPENSATORY TIME \nOn occasions where situations require irregular and scheduled overtime, work hours in excess of the established departmental work period, the employee shall receive overtime or compensatory time off at one and one-half (1-\u00bd) times the regular rate in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). All hours worked in excess of the established work period must be authorized in advance by the supervisor and/or department head. The City reserves the right to determine whether the employee may receive either overtime or compensatory time off. \nOvertime payment and/or compensatory time off shall not be approved by the department heads unless the employee\u2019s actual work hours have exceeded the established work period except as otherwise provided for in Sub-Section 6.4. Compensatory time off shall be counted as time worked. There are positions approved by the City Manager that are exempted from overtime as established by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Salary Administration Plan lists the approved exempt positions, which is available in the Human Resources Department. \nThe maximum compensatory time which may be accrued by any non-exempt employee shall be 480 hours for those engaged in public safety and emergency response, and 240 hours for all other employees. An employee who has accrued the maximum number of compensatory hours shall be paid overtime compensation for all additional overtime hours of work. Individual departments will be allowed to establish a lesser limit of compensatory hours subject to the approval of the City Manager. \nAn employee shall be permitted to use accrued compensatory time within a reasonable period after it is accrued, if to do so would not unduly disrupt the operations of the department.\n\n\n6.4.
