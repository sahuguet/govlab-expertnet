First, since a majority of our funding is federal (via the state of Alabama and direct) our cash flows are directly related to a variety of policy areas on which there has been little or no agreement.  Such areas include transportation policy, industrial policy, and healthcare.  Due to the politics and economics involved these policy areas have been and will continue to be extremely difficult to forecast with any certainly from year to year, much less over the course of five-years which would cover at least two federal Congresses and possibly two Presidents.  The last five years of the RPCGBs financial picture serves as a good indication.  \nIn 2006 we had a budget of approximately $3 million and ran a deficit of $1.6 million.  We had a staff of 38 at our peak.  During the course of the next five years, we dropped staff to 21 but then raised it back to 42 (with 9 more slated before the end of the year), created a positive and healthy fund balance.  Due to absorbing new programs, our budget will balloon to over $16 million by the end of this fiscal year.  There is absolutely no way we could or would have predicted such an increase during a recession.  \nWe could have included five year financial projections in our audit in 2007, but it would have been an exercise in futility.  More importantly it would have been worthless to anyone attempting to rely on such information.  \nSecond, I have no idea how much this GASB statement may be related to, or influenced by, the Jefferson County, Alabama bankruptcy, but having spent an enormous amount of time conducting research on the topic, rest assured five-year projections mean nothing in a kleptocracy.  The projections the county did present in their budget documents were disingenuous at best and mostly criminal. \nI do not see how adding five-year projections as RSI to audits will benefit anyone, rather they will come a burden to local jurisdictions across the country.\n\n\nPresenting five-year financial projections as RSI would be extremely problematic for the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham (we\u2019re a Council of Government).

All the research I've done on this indicates that you are both correct - a five-year financial projection is not only costly and and time consuming to prepare, but is also unreliable due to the wide and possibly inconsistent speculation that would have to be used by municipalities to project out that far. Furthermore, the actual benefit of requiring five-year projections (to governments, auditors, taxpayers) seems to be insignificant vis-a-vis what is already provided by most local governments.\n\n\nThanks Mark, and Louis.

In my own situation, the City produces both a five-year capital improvement plan as well as a five year fiscal plan & budget document.  Each year, we struggle with what assumptions to use for the plan update and our projections have tended toward the ultra-conservative, forecasting the \"worst-case\" scenario which rarely materializes.  Having said that, I believe it does have merit and is a useful tool particularly in educating staff and elected officials about the long-term costs of certain budget choices. All in all, I tend to agree with the thoughts already expressed that such a tool should be left up to (if not outright encouraged) the local government manager to implement as a  budget forecasting tool and left out the core financial statements.\n\n\nI tend to agree that multi-year forecasting is a useful tool in managing municipal budgets and am an advocate for such practices.

That said, I think that is should be a recommended practice and not a requirement.  Imposing five year planning as a mandate may actually reduce the effectiveness of its intended purpose as many governments may just produce a plan for perfunctory purposes in a CAFR.  The real value of a five year plan is in the budget process.  Also, I don't necessarily agree that it has to be a cashflow analysis.

  "text": "\n\nThe Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has proposed that state and local governments should submit five-year projections of financial obligations (to accompany annual financial statements) as required supplementary information. GASB believes that this would better enable various stakeholders to assess the financial health of the government.\nMore detail on this proposal can be found in the attached press release, including information on where to find the complete GASB proposal. GASB is accepting public comment on these proposed standards through March 16, 2012, and will host two public forums. In addition to submitting comments to GASB I would encourage you to share your thoughts here on how these standards, if adopted, will impact your financial reporting operations.\n\n",
