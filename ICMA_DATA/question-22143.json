It is probably also a good idea to let VLGMA know you are looking. Another member in transition who recently found a job suggests printing \"business card resumes\" to hand to colleagues at state meetings. Include your name and contact info on the front along with a brief statement explaining that you are looking for interim manager positions. On the back, provide your LinkedIn URL and consider briefly stating your experience. Finally, consider adding a sentence to the beginning of your ICMA profile that states what type of positions you are looking for. Hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Debi, I recommend contacting one of ICMA's Virginia Range Riders for state-specific advice. The roster is located at http://webapps.icma.org/rosters/index.cfm?roster=RR.
