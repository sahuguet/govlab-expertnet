Illinois law, for instance, states that \"No dog shall be deemed 'vicious' if it is a professionally trained dog for law enforcement or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be classified in a manner that is specific as to breed.\"\nWe (Oak Park, IL) regulate dangerous animals and vicious dogs, though not pit bulls, specifically. Aside from the fact that doing so is prohibited under state law, not all pit bulls are inherently dangerous. Did you know that the following, among others, kept pit bulls for pets: \nHelen Keller \nTheodore Roosevelt \nWoodrow Wilson \nGeneral George Patton \nIn addition, the dog in the Little Rascals was also a pit bull; a pit bull is also the only dog that was made a life member of the American Legion, the Red Cross, and the YMCA \u2013 Sergeant Stubby.\nMore than you needed to know, I suppose. In the event you\u2019re wondering, no \u2013 I have never owned a pit bull. I just happened to watch an Animal Planet show some time back following Michael Vick\u2019s arrest for dog fighting and animal cruelty. They conveyed all sorts of pit bull facts.\nI\u2019m a reptile fan, myself . . . and they have their own image problems.  :)\nBest,\nRob Cole\n\n\nHi, Joseph.\n\nSome states prohibit breed-specific regulations, though they permit regulation of viscious animals.
