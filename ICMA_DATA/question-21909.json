  "text": "\n\nWe are considering creating a purchasing department to help better manage and streamline purchases.  Currently, most purchases are done at the department level which works OK, but we have run into a few hiccups. Most of the purchasing is currently done \u201con account\u201d or by checking out one of the Town credit cards from finance.\nI\u2019ve been asked to start thinking about this scenario and thought I would start here.  It would be helpful to hear from those that have gone through this type of transition recently as well as anyone who currently has a documented workflow and policy in place.  What are some potential issues to keep in mind?  What would you change about your process?\nI realize this may be a loaded question/topic, but any help is greatly appreciated!!\n\n",
