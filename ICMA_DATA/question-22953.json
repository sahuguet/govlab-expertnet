  "text": "\n\nA community has fired two Administrators in the last six months.  The first was in his position for 11 years, the second was fired after 90 days.  I was the runner-up for the position 90 days ago.  The City Council is now very gun-shy, as they made a \"bad-hire\".  I have spoken with the Mayor Pro-tem (the Mayor was out of town) and voiced that my interest in the position remains.  One thing I am considering is offering to be an Interim Administrator as a \"try me out\" option to soothe their fears.  I do not know if this is a good or bad option and I am looking for guidance.  I am familiar with the community as I was interviewed twice before and have made two additional trips to the community.  I am familiar with the issues that they face and I strongly believe I can help.  \nI could really use feedback ASAP.  Thank you all in advance.\n\n",
