  "text": "\n\nAssessing improved methods to compensate management (unrepresented employees such as Directors, Department Heads, etc).  \nIn years past, they have been provided an across-the-board increase of say 3%. \nI favor something less general and more synchronized with overall, orgnaizational performance.  I see how a scorecard of various factors leading to a percentage increase could work.  \nLooking for some examples of best practices and management compensation policies/plans that reward strong departmental performance but are not administratively nightmarish. \nThanks.\n\n",
