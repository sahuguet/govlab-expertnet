  "text": "\n\nI am the Fire Chief of the city of Meridian Mississippi and we currently use a 24 hours on and 48 hours off shift schedule for our suppression division. This works out to a 56 hour work week on a 28 day cycle. We currently employ 111 supression personnel, 8 fire stations with 10 apparatus manned by 3 firefighters each and one command vehicle with two persons. our current set up is three shifts with 37 people per shift utizilizing 5 for vacation sick time and schools.\nMy question is what are the benifits if any of changing to a 24 hour on and 24 hour off shift schedule similar to the schedule used by federal firefighters. The routine work week averaged out to 72 hours each week. Most fire departments had the \u201cA\u201d shift and the \u201cB\u201d shift. About once a month, a Kelly day (a day of rest given to firefighters during their work cycle) was given to allow the firefighters off for three days.\nAdminstration is considerating a move to this schedule I am trying to caculate any savings and cannot find any. Any help will be appreciated.\n\n",
