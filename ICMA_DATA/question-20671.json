How does Smart Growth play a role in meeting those demands? \nSince the end of World War II, the move was to build further and further out from city centers. Land and gas were cheap and it seemed like the American dream was to have a ranch house on an acre of land someplace outside of the city. The problem began when those same individuals expected the same services they had received in the city center: paved roads, full utilities, snowplows whenever it snowed (or for any amount), trash pickup, etc.   While building the initial infrastructure is costly, maintaining the infrastructure has to be taken into account at some point during its lifecycle.  It makes a substantial financial difference if there are 20 homes per mile to share the cost of maintenance and reconstruction than if there is one. \nTimothy noted Detroit; it is a good example of how \"bad growth\" has taken place. The City originally was built for 2.5 million people but today has less than 900,000. The problem is that those 900,000 people are spread across the same area as the 2.5 million with the same infrastructure (and aging infrastructure). The costs of service in Detroit are high (in addition to other problems) because there are now 1.6 million less people by which the cost can be shared. \nSmart Growth has a number of other dimensions ranging from walkability, health and environmental management.\n\n\nIt is rare to find an administrator or manager who says that they have all of the money they need to meet the demands of the community they serve.

For example, there are cost-effective alternatives to installing the typical water infrastructure in new developments that will reduce both water usage and the tax burden for fire stations, firefighters and apparatus. I find that very few jurisdictions consider such relationships and consequently overlook how they can reduce environmental impact, improve water conservation and fire protection, all while reducing future tax burdens at the same time.\n\n\nTrue smart growth considers the relationships between systems, services and infrastructure.

The City of Detroit, for example, is surrounded by incorporated suburbs, therefore outward growth is not possible.  Like you said, it does benefit the planner, but is it not wiser to use what already exists, rather than contribute to low density development ? Maybe sprawl can never be stopped altogether, but smart growth can contain it.\n\n\nSmart Growth utilizes existing infrastructure as opposed to outward growth; sprawl.
