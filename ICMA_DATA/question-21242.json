Our existing cross-departmental DurhamFirst Steering Team is spearheading the effort. In addition to viewing the webinars together, we are converting a Quarterly Lunch and Learn with the City Manager (that targeted graduates of our Leadership Development programs) to quarterly lunch meetings that will focus on innovation in our organization.
