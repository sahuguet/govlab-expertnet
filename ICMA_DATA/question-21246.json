The fund shall be administered by the City Manager or his/her designee and shall only be used for the planting of new trees on City owned or leased properties, rights-of-way and other public properties such as public schools, county and State properties located within the City of Colleyville.\"\nCosts to bury power lines are very high and using tree mitigation funds alone would probably not get there. However, I like where you are headed and there are many things other than tree plantings for which the funds could be utilized.\n\n\nKristi, here is what our ordinance states: \"Colleyville Tree Preservation Fund: All mitigation fees shall be paid into the Colleyville Tree Preservation Fund.

  "text": "\n\nAnyone have a policy/ordinance on what they actually DO with their tree replacement fund?  We have a general statement in the code, but no guidelines or policy.  As best I can tell, we've been collecting the funds but haven't used them much.  \nAny creative ideas out there?  Anyone thought about leveraging them to bury power lines?\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
