We are looking for ways to more effectively resolve taxpayer compliance and customer service issues and recover unpaid or underreported tax revenue.  If your city has embarked on such a project, could you share stories, results.  If there are any examples of RFP's or contact names, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
