With them and the remaining 160+ jurisdictions participating in the program, CPM collects, verifies, and analyzes performance data on a range of public safety, neighborhood and internal services -- all using a set of consistent definitions.  Others you might find comparable could include those participating in the Center's regional consortia in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas.\nFor more information on CPM, including a list of participants by population size, please visit http://icma.org/performance.\n\n\nTom -- ICMA's Center for Performance Measurement includes three New Mexico jurisdictions (Bernalillo County, Las Cruces, and Los Alamos County).
