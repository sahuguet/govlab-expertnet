  "text": "\n\nThe City of Eustis, FL has established a community events calendar on the homepage of the website.  Has anyone came up with defining what can (and cannot) be posted on this calendar?  So far, I come up with that it must be open to the public (not a private event), that it be in the City, and that it not be a sales event.  I would like to come up with some guidelines because this has the potential to open a can of worms.\n\n",
