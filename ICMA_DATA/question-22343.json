  "text": "\n\nGood day colleagues,\n   The City of Presque Isle, Maine is seeking a list of qualified consultants to assist us with a capital campaign/fund raising effort to seek outside funding of half of the cost of a voter supported community center (estimated to cost $7.5 million).  A RFQ will hit the streets in the next week or so.\n    If there are any communities that have used such a firm, could you please send me the name and location of the firm, along with any comments to me directly at jbennett@presqueisleme.us?  We are obviously more interested in firms in the Northeast US or Canada.\n     Thank you in advance for your assistance.   Happy New Year\nJim Bennett,  PI, ME  City Manager\n\n",
