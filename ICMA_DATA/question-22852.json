In 2013, Dubuque completed a study of the imact of the arts on economic development. It is significant.\nThe community has a private not-for-profit convention and visitor's bureau (www.traveldubuque.org) and a private not-for-profit economic development group (www.greaterdubuque.org). Dubuque Main Street (www.dubuquemain street.org) also works on these issues. The organizations work together, but are not consolidated.\nThe community has a severe workforce housing shortage because of significant job growth, 5.1 % GDP growth and 3.6% unemployment. It is being dealt with by creating incentives to rehabilitate vacant buildings and upper stories on buildings in the downtown. Almost 300 rental units have been created in the downtown in the last three years, with a goal of approximately 1,000 within 5 years. Dubuque is combining this with an over $200 millon flood protection initiative that will eliminate flooding in the north end of Dubuque where much of the existing workforce (rental and owner occupied) housing exists. Part of the strategy is the placement of pervious pavers in 240 alleys improving their appearance and also daylighting a creek that was previously buried in an underground culvert creating a linear park through the neighborhoods with a hike/bike trail and over a 1,000 new trees and bushes.\nMike\nMike\n\n\nLoretta,\n\nI do not know if what Dubuque (www.cityofdubuque.org) is doing fits your question, but I would be happy to visit with you if you call (563-589-4110).

For example, not only can this lingage provide a catalyst for economic development, but it can alsobe an economic multiplier, improving the quality of life in all areas and can be used as an important recruiting tool to target people with special skills or talents as well as encourage new and expanding businesses to your community.  It can serve as a stimulus and have a direct effect on vistor spending on specific sectors of your local economy including lodging, meals and other goods and services.  Indeed, the economic benefit extends beyond this and includes increased spending by local businesses -- a \"spin-off\" effect due to increased demands.  Incresed employment in these businesses will also result in additional consumer spending by employees.\nHope this gives you some addtional thoughts that might help.\n\n\nIn reference to your question on economic development strategies that are linked to local tourism entities, the arts community and, housing I offer that you also need anunderstanding of the second and third order of effects.
