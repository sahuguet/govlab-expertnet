      "text": "\n\nHi Tom:\nIn looking into some of the approaches taken by other local governments, I found the story of a local government from Washington State encountering similar needs, but taking a different approach to the situation.  As the attached document explains, the city of North Bend, WA had previously had to cut their cable program, and wanted to put out a RFP for an outside vendor to do the filming of council meetings and the like.  After considering the costs involved, they realized that instead of an annual cost of approximately $15,000-20,000 they could actually have a one-time cost of 19,000 and have the equipment installed so they could film the proceedings themselves.  They have had enormous successful with this system ever since, and I think it could be a great option to consider!\nAccording to North Bend\u2019s website http://ci.north-bend.wa.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={EF4EF17D-98E6-42C5-A1FE-D6EAB7D8F835} , you could contact their City Clerk, Cheryl Proffitt-Schmidt by email at cproffitt@northbendwa.gov for further information.\nI hope this helps!\nMike\n\n\nHi Tom:\n\nIn looking into some of the approaches taken by other local governments, I found the story of a local government from Washington State encountering similar needs, but taking a different approach to the situation.
