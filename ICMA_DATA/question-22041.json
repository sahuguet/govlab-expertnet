This might be more interesting than the larger turnover rate, particularly if you are trying to infuse the organization with a new culture.    Do you perform exit interviews with standard \"reasons for leave\"?  If so, that might be good data to look at.  \nMy community is currently coordinating with staff to create an employee survey as well.  Our focus in that effort is of course to gather some end user data to set baselines for our satisfaction outcome measures.   However, many of our current measures are output or cycle time focused.  In our performance management efforts,  we are examining the balance between thoroughness and speed of our hiring and application process.  We measure several timeframes related to that process and are seeking technology solutions to help with user satisfaction and timeliness.  \nDr. David Ammons book on Municipal Benchmarks has a few suggestions that might be useful for you also.  And I couldn't post on an ICMA site without of course recommending taking a look at the CPM templates.\n\n\nPerhaps another way to look at turnover would be to restrict it to \"% new hires retained after (x) months/year(s) of employment\".

  "text": "\n\nI am the performance management director for a municipality that is historically dysfunctional and is undergoing significant transformational reforms. We are identifying citywide outcome measures, and for our city workforce services area, we are discussing which would be a good measure to select. We know that an employee survey, similar to the one Gallup uses, is probably the best way to obtain good information about the job satisfaction and engagement of the city work force? But are there other good, non-survey derived measures? Employee turnover is one suggested measure, but some have argued that in an organization undergoing reforms, high turnover is to be expected and may not necessarily be undesirable?\nWhat measures do you use in your organizations?\n\n",
