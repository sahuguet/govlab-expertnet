One of the Range Riders I corresponded with said, \"I will tell Mr. Gormley that he needs to settle in one spot, get some part time work (even if outside city management), and then join the local manager network.\" Applying from inside the area rather than outside the area should make it easier to get an interim or full time position.\n\n\nHi Tom, I forwarded your question to a couple of ICMA Range Riders (see http://webapps.icma.org/rosters/index.cfm?roster=RR for the full list of Range Riders), so I think someone will be responding to you via e-mail soon.

Most of all but one job I came accross are all full time positions. Does anyone have any suggesitons on this or is there possibly a head hunter in the northeast that anyone is aware of that could steer me in the right direction. Thanks Tom\n\n",
