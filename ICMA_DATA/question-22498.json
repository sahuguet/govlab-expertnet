  "text": "\n\nI work for a Fire District. I know this may be somewhat different than the municipality, but overall subject may be similar. We are proposing to have our labor representative work in administration two days a week. We currently are calling the position Quality Control Officer. I am looking for some info on job description, how to pay him (overtime, salary from new position, or flat hourly rate that he currently makes now when working at the fire station). If you have any other ideas of how to make this work it would be much appreciated.\nThanks,\nCody\n\n",
