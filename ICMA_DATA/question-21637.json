  "text": "\n\nI live in a Kansas community of roughly 25,000 people. Our downtown district (essentially 3.5 streets stretched out over 10 blocks) is currently experiencing an influx of pigeons. Naturally, their droppings are becoming a major concern. In your experience, what has been the most effective way of dealing with this problem? Are long term solutions (poison, sterilization) any better or more cost effective than short term solutions (spike strips, ultrasonic repellents, etc.)?\n\n",
