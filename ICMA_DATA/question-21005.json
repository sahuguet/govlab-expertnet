It has been my experience, that in Phoenix we have several layers of \"onboarding\".  \nThere are several days of City training. All City specific paperwork and documentation is taken care of during this process. Next, a few days of department training with associated forms and processes being completed, and then some Section specific training.  \nThe computer, building, and other access issues are held at the department level. We are a very large City, so that works best for us. All is triggered once the new-hire paperwork clears the HR processes. \nThis is much easier to track when hiring groups of people. It can take the specific care of a single person keeping track of the processes that have been completed (we use a Supervisory checklist to help supervisors make sure all the details have been completed) when we hire only one person.\n\n\nHi Jon, I am speaking as a user/Supervisor, not from the technical expertise of our HR Department.

  "text": "\n\nI call upon the collective power of the ICMA Knowledge Network to figure out how we can better address the onboarding process. We seem to fall short in the workflow from one department to the next on what it takes to get our act together when hiring a new employee. It seems as though there is a disconnect between making that final offer to the employees first day. For example, what physical access do they need? What computer profile needs to be ready? What is the protocol on explaining certain policies and procedures? We just don't seem to be very consistent and come across as a little unprepared. \nHow do you do it? What checklists, process, or workflow do you follow? Is the department or HR responsible for everything? \nAny assistance you can offer would be very appreciated.\n\n",
