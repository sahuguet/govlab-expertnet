  "text": "\n\nIn the fall I'll be a second-year student at Cornell's Institute for Public Affairs, and am now serving on ICMA's Advisory Committee for Graduate Education.  \nI'd so appreciate hearing from any of you MPA/MPP students (or anyone else, for that matter!) who've had experience with coursework specifically designed to teach policymakers how to direct quantitative analyses, and to assess the quality/credibility of those analyses when received.  \nI have access to plenty of courses teaching us how to perform statistical analyses--so that's not what I'm needing to identify here.  Instead, I'm hoping for coursework that would teach competence in requesting and using those stats:  how to critically evaluate the assumptions on which they're based, and the results.\nMy direct email is pm486@cornell.edu--thanks for any feedback you can give me!\n\n",
