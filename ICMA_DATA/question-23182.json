IF you have such software, that might be a tool to use for the lease dates.

We needed to track contracts better and discovered our existing software had that capability.  The nice part about having it as part of the agenda management system is the avoidance of redundant data entry.  Since every lease or similar agreement must be approved by the Commission anyway, you just set an expiration date some period if time (say 120 days) ahead of the actual contract expiration and it will email the employee responsible.\n\n\nIf you have software that handles agenda management, check to see if it has functionality that will do what you want.
