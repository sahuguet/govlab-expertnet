  "text": "\n\nHello-\nI am working on some research for a university project analyzing Private vs Public EMS systems.  I saw some dated documentation (from 2003) that referenced a ICMA report which surveyed municipalities and counties to understand how the EMS services are provided.\nI struggled to find a more recent document.  Can anyone point me in the direction of some relevant documentation or studies that the ICMA has performed?\nThanks in advance for your help.\nJoe\n\n",
