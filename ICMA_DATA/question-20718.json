This won't be new money, it will supplant the operational funds we currently receive.  Unfortunately under the law, the 1% will only be allowed to be used for capital expenses.  That would be devasting for our local channel and we are working hard to support the Community Access Preservation (CAP) Act, or some version of it, at the federal level so those funds can be used for operations.\n\n\nGary - we currently use the PEG portion of our Franchise Fees for maintenance/capital/operations of our locally controlled government access channel.\n\nWe too are about to receive an additional 1% for PEG uses under the transition to the new statewide DIVCA contract.

Make absolutely certain that only government agencies use the government channel with no exceptions.  I was in a city where we let some non-profit groups used and then received a request from the KKK to show one of their videos.  We declined , they sued and we lost.  The court said we could not invoke the government use provision because we had allowed non-government interest to use the channel.  We were ordered to show the KKK video.  Hence at that point the channel was subject to only the First Amendment limitations which are vary board.  If you limit the G to only government, then you can protect your right for only government entities to use.  Other groups can use the P (public) channel.\n\n\nThe others offer good advice.
