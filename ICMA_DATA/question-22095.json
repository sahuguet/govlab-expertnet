Some of the delay is built into that process as the state agencies deal with allocation issues, authorized equipment, lists and the application rules for local governments. Then you through into the mix that some items may need to go through a public procurement process that adds to the timelines.\nThe larger issue is that we still don't have a good definition of preparedness and that some localities should be more involved in state/regional efforts and not acting independently.\n\n\nThese funds in many cases get passed through state emergency management agencies to localities.

This largely involves deciding how the money will be divided across the country.  Next, there is a similar delay at the State level deciding how the money will be divided among jurisdictions.  I cannot pull it from memory but it seems that it takes almost a year before we actually receive notice of what we \u201cmight\u201d receive.\nOnce we receive notification of award, we have to develop a spending plan \u2013 identifying the equipment, training, or whatever priorities the grant specifies \u2013 and submit that to a State grant manager, who then forwards it to DHS for approval.  Eventually we get a green light to start the procurement process.\nFinally, we have to get quotes, bids, etc, and make the purchases.  Sometimes there are delays  in the bid process or in the contracting process.  Sometimes there are delays in product manufacturing that push out the actual payment date.  All in all, it is a lengthy process.\n\n\nThe following response is from Durham County Emergency Management: \n\nFirst, there is a huge delay in the Federal system from the time the DHS appropriation is made official to the time money is actually sent to DHS, then down to the states.

  "text": "\n\nFEMA reports that as much as 25% of disaster preparedness funds granted to state and local governments have not been spent. Since 2003 DHS has granted $35 billion to state and local governments for disaster preparedness activities.\nProgram administrators believe that the delay is related to issues in regulation, environmental review, and the budgeting/procurement process. ICMA would be interested to know any additional reasons for delays in spending these funds.\nSource: http://www.executivegov.com/2012/03/fema-official-25-of-local-disaster-funds-not-spent/\n\n",
