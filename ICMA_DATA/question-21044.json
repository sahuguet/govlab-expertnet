We are working with 5 pilot cities in Uganda (around 100,000 in population) and are looking to start an internet based mentoring program for the town clerks (city managers) involved in this project.\nIf you are interested, please send me an e-mail.  My name is Tim Honey, former city manager of Portland, Maine and Boulder, Colordo.  I am now doing mostly international consulting work in Africa.  My e-mail address is: timhoney@aol.com.
