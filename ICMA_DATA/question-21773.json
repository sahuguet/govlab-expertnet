More often \"internship\" is being used for still-in-school, summer-only, or undergraduate level assignments.\nFor the Local Government Management Fellowship program, a term we are using to \"brand\" the experience, so both mentor and fellow know what the job entails, is city manager apprentice. \nA lot also depends on the job description. A city-manager-in-training I would say deserves the title Fellow. A learn-about-local-government-and-we-also-have-spreadsheets experience is more of an internship. In the end the exact title means less than the valuable skills the intern/fellow can carry forward. But as we move forward it makes sense to settle on a term that can summarize the experience.\nAs you design your program, let ICMA know if you'd like to have access to our screened pool of Fellowship finalists (currently available). We broker a screening and placement process for hosting graduate-level Fellows. http://icma.org/lgmf\n\n\nThat's a good question.

      "text": "\n\nI recently posted an answer to this on a similar thread:\nI've given a lot of thought to this topic as I've helped design our own program here in Fort Collins. In addition, I've had a fair amount of experience competing for national internships across the country over the last two years. \nI am a big supporter of the two-year program because it demonstrates committment to the intern. With just one year, you really spend too much time getting up to speed and then preparing for your exit and next step. I believe that both the intern and the City get more from a longer 2-year term. \nAs for naming, I really like the model that some of the very best programs use, like Long Beach, in calling it a Management Assistant program, which is what we've now done in Fort Collins. It's very substantive and gives the \"intern\" a little more to show both with co-workers during the year(s) as well as on his/her resume afterwards. Another great program, Tacoma, give a title promotion and small salary increase between the two years, which is another great way to show progression and get more out of your investment. \nAs far as appeal, yes, it definitely needs to be paid if you want the best and brightest out there because if not then another city/program will snatch those people up. I would also recommend advertising on ICMA and with top MPA programs in order to perform a competitive national recruitment.\n\n\nI recently posted an answer to this on a similar thread:\n\nI've given a lot of thought to this topic as I've helped design our own program here in Fort Collins.
