  "text": "\n\nI've been asked by my Council to provide sample evaluation documents for the City Attorney, Municipal Court Judge, City Clerk and City Manager (me).  While I have a couple of sample evaluations for the City Manager, can anyone share or point me to where I might find evaluation documents for the other positions?  I'd also appreciate additional City Manager evaluation documents as well.\nThank you,\nCrandall O. Jones\n\n",
