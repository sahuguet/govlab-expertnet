I can say in my experience producing video that the costs can vary widely by geographic area, by experience level of the crew, and by things that impact the final product like how many cameras you need, if you need studio space, the length of the final piece, sound, editing, and more. \nIf this is a recurring and fairly straightforward thing like recording and broadcasting council meetings, you can check out national service providers. You could give your videographer the option to beat the price if it looks competitive. If you're coming to the annual conference, there are usually a few such providers in the exhibit hall.\nOnce you have a little more info, you could also change to a fixed price contract versus hourly - we'll pay you $X to do this, and you can spend as much time as you'd like rewiring things.\n\n\nI don't have an RFP, but I do have a few quotes for services rendered if you're interested.
