  "text": "\n\nHas anyone ever used the stream of income from a Building Department Enterprise Fund to build a new building for the Building Department?\nI am thinking that we may be able to do that and charge the other entities \"rent\" and use those funds along with revenue from operations to retire the funding mechanism(bonds).
