You may not save anything because the ease of purchase results in more items being purchased than may have been needed.\nhttp://home.uchicago.edu/ourminsky/Goal-Gradient_Illusionary_Goal_Progress.pdf\n$300,000 @ 2% means you get $6,000 cash back. So if use accelerates and you actually spend $310,000 where before it would have only been $300,000, you get back $6,200 but are out of pocket a net -$3,800. Do you have inventory controls in place to stop unneeded inventory from accumulating?\nIt will only work if you can maintain tight control on items purchased, such as the old purchase order route. But with a credit card, pre-approval sometimes goes away with post-purchase review taking its place. Not quite the same thing.\n\n\nJust a word of caution: credit cards accelerate the spending of money.

      "text": "\n\nWe have an American Express Corporate Card that earns points and can be redeemed for cash or travel to conferences, etc.  We have yet to utilize any of the points as we're finalizing a policy to the board on redemption.\nWe only use the card for paying our water bill to the City of Chicago which is roughly $1 MM a year.  So while I understand the concerns by Mr. Woods, for us, it was somewhat of a \"no brainer\" as the cost exists regardless - might as well receive a benefit (besides the water, of course).  I think if you use it for major purchases such as water, refuse, etc., it could prove to be beneficial.\n\n\nWe have an American Express Corporate Card that earns points and can be redeemed for cash or travel to conferences, etc.  We have yet to utilize any of the points as we're finalizing a policy to the board on redemption.\n\nWe only use the card for paying our water bill to the City of Chicago which is roughly $1 MM a year.

  "text": "\n\nThe Town of Milton, Vermont is considering moving more of our purchases to a credit card with a cash back percentage.  Most cards we looked at have either 1.5% or 2% cash back.  Can anyone provide feedback if their community has done/does this and how well it works or any challenges encountered? \nSome background:\nWe are a community of 10,500 with about $6.5 million general fund and $2 million enterprise funds.  We currently use a credit card for some purchases but there is no cash back and we only put about $7,000-10,000 per year on it.  We have identified at least $300,000 in expenses that could be charged to a credit card and get 1.5/2% back on.\nMuch appreciated.\nTony Mazzucco\ntmazzucco@town.milton.vt.us\n\n",
