  "text": "\n\nI have been working with a homeless task force to determine the best approach for the service providers as well as the city to collaborate together in breaking the cycle of the transient homeless. WE have been exploring many possibilities and one idea has surfaced...has any city or non-profit provided some sort of clearinghouse before serving the homeless population?\nOne of the many issues is that many \"work\" the system and take advantage of each agency because of lack of communication. One thought, other than consolidation is having an agency or centralized service determine the need and clear them for the appropriate service provider. \nSo, if anyone has any stories or programs to share on consolidation, collaboration of services for the homeless, please share.\n\n",
