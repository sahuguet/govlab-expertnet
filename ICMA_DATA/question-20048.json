Each city must evaluate the stability of its revenue sources, cash flow needs and probability of an emergency/disaster.   Because the volatility of the intergovernmental revenue we receive from the state,  the relatively high probability of massive snow removal expenditures and the desire to maintain a relatively high bond rating, our policy sets a minimum reserve of 75% of annual revenues.  This allows us to cash flow up to seven months of the year until we get our first tax disbursement and intergovernmental revenue disbursement.  We have also developed a revenue stabilization policy to deal with mid-year delays and or reductions in the intergovernmental revenue.  We can borrow, from our fund balance, up to 10% of annual revenues over a two year period following a national recession.  We must then pay back the fund balance over the following eight years or until the minimum fund balance is restored.\n\n\nThere is no magic number for a minimum or maximum fund balance.
