Severe impact would be an extended power outage or closure to major thoroughfares.  A power outage of a major facility such as a nursing home that does not have generator backup may also call for activation.  Structural damage of multiple facilities or a major facility would also be a consideration. A typical operation period would be 8 to 12 hours.  The impact will typically dictate the ESF's that we fill.\n\n\nWe typically activate our EOC if the impact is going to be severe for more than a normal operational period.

      "text": "\n\nOur City's concept of operation is based upon several themes, including an incident typology following the ICS documentation: Type 1 -5, with Type 5 being a single department response to a Type 1 catastrophic response.  Based upon the typology differing level of activation, functions, and staffing are considered.   We tend to get away from a single indicator of activation and base activation upon the concept of situational assessment.  There are multiple variables to consider: hazard, warnings, timing, communications disruptions, potential impacts, human needs, demands for services that need to be taken into consideration.  A final consideration is the capabilities for interoperability communications and data.  Our communications systems include: virtual web based crisis management applications, robust email notification lists, reverse communication capabilities, and video/telephone conferencing capabilities.  The decision to open the EOC is then based upon situational awareness, interoperability, and direction/control needs, no one standard applies, the level of EOC operations is based upon the potential demand and threat and determining a desired level of response based upon the incident.  Lastly, the EOC activation might be based upon political decisions, training, and exercise considerations as an opportunity to engage the EOC staff and organization.\n\n\nOur City's concept of operation is based upon several themes, including an incident typology following the ICS documentation: Type 1 -5, with Type 5 being a single department response to a Type 1 catastrophic response.
