  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for a policy or annual process in place to determine a priority for the transfer of your Private Activity Bond Cap.  Douglas County has transferred its cap to the Nevada Rural Hosing Authority in past years, but is now interested in determining the priority for this year's transfer (e.g. creation of jobs vs. affordable housing).   If you have transferred bond cap to private industry, I'm also interested in what forms/applications you have used.\n\n",
