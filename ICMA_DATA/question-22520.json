You've already demonstrated you are serious about your career by joining a professional association, and that's good. Be sure to highlight that and any related volunteer work on your resume.\nMany industries have a bias against \"outsiders\"and local government is not different. But the demands for talent created by the retiring Boomers will force a change to that I believe. Like Marcos mentions, you might see if you can get some hands-on experience working in a local government. If you're in a position where you are working already in a full time job and taking classes, you can still find some volunteer work that shouldn't take much time and gain some good connections and exposure to how a community works.\nWhen crafting your resume, focus less on where you worked and more on transferable skills. This is sometimes called a \"functional resume\" and can help highlight skills applicable to local government work you are seeking.\nLastly, keep an eye out this fall for a new guidebook for career changers. We have a membership task force that is creating that at this moment! It will be announced in our membership newsletter, and linked on http://icma.org/careers.\n\n\nI would suggest you begin networking with people in local government that do the kind of work you'd like to transition to.
