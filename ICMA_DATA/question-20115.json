The ability to display trends over time and links with forecasting and scenario planning functions to illustrate the potential impact of EECBG energy and water efficiency programs, capital projects, building retirements and constructions, and transportation programs is required. \nFeatures should include:\n1) Leverage existing systems and reduce duplication of effort for tracking and reporting.\n2) Integrate multiple management systems, programs, and contractors to support on-going operations tracking and reporting.\n3) Produce standardized reports that include key performance metrics for Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) funding (on both a per project and total program basis), including: jobs created and retained, energy saved, renewable energy produced, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced, cost-sharing, and lifecycle financial performance.\n4) Have the ability to track emissions and changes in emissions across multiple sectors of activity, as noted in the Climate Action Plan. The main emission sectors for emissions include transportation, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and municipal activities. A key component of the proposed program should be  the identification of methods by which emissions from all activities can be tracked and monitored, including both public and private activities.\n5) Coordinate with community funding program to track energy savings\n6) Coordinate with the city website to allow public access to information required under Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) to be updated on a quarterly basis.\n7) Be easily managed by City staff and require minimal maintenance.\n\n\nThomas,  The following may assist you with developing specifications. \ngood luck.\n\nThe system should be designed to easily report indicators required for the EECBG and link with existing data to eliminate duplicate data entry.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Cartersville is preparing to develop an RFP for Energy Management Software (EMS) as part of our EECBG project.  I am interested to know if anyone has any experience with EMS, and if they have any advice on what to include in the bid specifications.  We will be using this software to track energy consumption, estimate savings from retrofits/upgrades (cost avoidance), and report to our state agency overseeing the grant (predominantly emissions reductions).  If you have a sample RFP, that would be extremely appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your feedback!\n\n",
