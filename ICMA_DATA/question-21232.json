I have most of the environmental outreach programs for the City and we are redesigning our website to better communicate with our residents and businesses. Currently we are looking at hits, but our real focus is looking at how may people register for our HHW appointments online and then opt-in to receive environmental updates from the City. \nIn the last year we have built a 2,700 e-mail address list (community of 130,000). When we launch our new website in the fall we will be driving traffic online with the goal of increasing opt-ins. We would also look at time on the pages as a partial determination if they are meeting residents needs.  Through our online HHW registrations and requiring registrants to identify how they have heard about the event we have been able to identify which advertising is successful and which is cost -prohibitive. One source was $98 per participant and another was $8.00. We have substantially altered our advertising mix as a result and are testing different ads to see if we can reduce further. That has been one of the biggest benefits of our online program. \nBest John\n\n\nHi Pamela, \n\nI would be interested in anything that you come up with.
