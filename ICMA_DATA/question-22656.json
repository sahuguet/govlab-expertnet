As part of this safety-net Human Services provides assessment and referral for a number of services that are supported through the Community Assistance Grant Fund Process.  These services include shelter beds, permenant supportive housing, showers, health and case management.  The City of Beverly Hills has an homeless outreach team that engages and offers assistance to the homeless members of this community.  In addition to this service, we have no camping and aggressive panhandling ordinances. After offering assistance, we enforce the ordinances as a last resort.  We then work with the City prosecutor and County District Attorney to offer help instead of jail when the individual appears in court. To establish a consistent approach, we have a Homeless Collaboration that meets once a month made up of city employess (PD, Library, park maintenance, outreach team, parking), social service providers, faith-based organizations and interested residents to work together on the issue of hoomelessness. The collaboration allows for open communication about our local homeless and prevents duplication of services.  Please give me a call at (310) 285-2535 if you would like to hear more details. \nJim Latta, L.C.S.W.\n\n\nMr. Betts,\n\nThe City of Beverly Hills General Plan states that the city will provide a social services safety-net for the vulnerable members of this community.
