You can work your way up to City/County Management through most any department; Economic Development, Public Works, Planning etc. Without experience you have little chance of getting a CM position, especially with all the managers in transition these days. Take an entry level position in local government, or as Nick stated non-profits, and be prepared to move frequently to facilitate climbing the ladder more quickly. Good luck.\n\n\nDerek, I followed a simialr course, that is college after military, and spent 20 years in the public sector.

I can honestly say if I didn't have my MPA I would not be as efficient or as well prepared as I am; further, I worked my way up from a associate planner at a regional Metropolitan Planning Council to a management (supervision of staff and budget) position in the second largest city in the state of MI and then after a couple of years experience under my belt I was able to successfully be hired in a CM position.  I am not trying to discourage you, however I believe the advice you have been given regarding applying for CM/CA positions by your mentor was premature-it's very RARE to land that spot without a graduate level degree unless you have worked your way up through the ranks.  I know in my advertising and hiring even for an assistant manager I looked for someone with a MPA or who was nearing completion of the degree and I wanted someone with at least three to five years municipal experience.  It might be good to look at the jobs page and review the minimum experience and/or education required by employers for those looking for CAO slots.  I would recommend that you pursue a master's degree, intern with a local government and look for a middle to upper management position and get some experience under your belt.  I left my last post voluntarily (was going to go back and get my JD) and I sent out over fifty resumes, had numerous phone and online interviews, and it took me almost six months to find another CAO position-and I have over a decade of municipal experience under my belt.  More and more communities are requiring not only an MPA but a minimum of ten years experience in the public sector, most of which is in a management capacity with a majority of CAO responsibilities.  The field is highly competitive and my recommendation to you would be to work towards building a resume reflective of on the job experience combined with education.   Best of luck and thank your for keeping us safe!\n\n\nDerek, I agree with most on here, going directly for the top spot is not an easy task.

I am a veteran of 9 years in the U.S Army that included a combat tour in Afghanistan.  I have done extremely well in my studies here and have had a great mentor in Orville Powell helping to further my education.  Although my mentor has suggested I apply for a city administrator position initially after graduation , he has also advised me to tap the resources of this forum to get a broader range of advice regarding present career path choices in the current market.  \n My studies, both classroom and personal, are aimed at city management and I am currently interning in the city within the Economic and Sustainable Development department.  I wish to work in the Southeast Region of the U.S, but securing a position upon graduating is more important than the location of that position.  \n\n I am needing guidance on both realistic expectations for initial job placement and what my career path approach might be as I was unable to find a comparable example to relate to.  \n\n Thank you in advance for any input you can provide on this.\n\nRegards,\nDerek Tidball\nDerek.Tidball@gmail.com\n\n",
