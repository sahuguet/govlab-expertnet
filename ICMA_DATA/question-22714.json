  "text": "\n\nAccording to ICMA's State of the Professional Survey (2012), average number of years in the local government management profession equated to 20.5 years.  The same survey showed that the average tenure in the manager position was about 7 years.\nIn all of those years in the profession and position, have you made any serious mistakes?  How'd did you overcome those mistakes and learn from them?  Don't answer here; we have a better venue for you.  \nWe are looking for individuals -- from senior-level to first-timer -- to come tell relay their mistake-and-overcome stories during the \"Forging Onward After Failure\" session at this year's ICMA Annual Conference in Boston.  Right now, two brave ICMA members have graciously volunteered to share their experiences and we welcome you too.  The session is on Tuesday, September 24, from 3:30p - 4:10p.  \nIf you're interested and free during that time, please contact me directly (jdailey@icma.org / 202-962-3557) and I will give you all the details.\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\n",
