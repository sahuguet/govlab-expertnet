  "text": "\n\nThe City of Chula Vista has recently implemented Legistar paperless agenda software. During our process improvement events one of the issues which was identified as causing delays in the agenda submittal process was that staff oftentimes submitted poorly written reports. We are going to offer training to our employees and I was wondering if any agencies had developed a agenda/staff report writing guide for issues being presented to your City Council/Board for action. Any help would be appreciated.\nThank You.\n\n",
