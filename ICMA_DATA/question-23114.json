If a property has no issues for two consecutive years, the inspection frequency moves to every three years.\n\u2022 Are the inspections completed by city staff or contracted - City staff \n\u2022 What is the charge for inspections - $100 per application for a hotel/motel permit (which prompts the inspection).  For establishments without issues, this would amount to $100 every three years.\n\u2022 What do you inspect or how complete are the inspections?  Codes Compliance inspects for building structure/maintenance and sanitary conditions, the Fire Department conducts its annual Fire Code inspection,  and the Police Department assesses the crime stats for that property from the previous year and makes security suggestions (if warranted).  We typically inspect 10% of the rooms, but if there are major issues, we may inspect the entire property.\nI hope this is helpful. If you have any additional questions about our program, please feel free to contact me directly.\nFlave H.
