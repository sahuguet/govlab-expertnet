      "text": "\n\nHi Leslie,\nyour question is more complex than it sounds.  A public finance course can have three very different meanings.  For an economist, public finance can be traced to Richard Musgrave's book--entitled Public Finance.  Over time, this has evolved into the field called public economics and is primarily focused on government revenues and expenditures--not on budgeting.  There are many textbooks that you can examine to put together a syllabus and the National Tax Association has some fine resources.  Another definitional stream revolves around capital and debt markets.  the best place to find topics to discuss would be to go the Bond Buyer's conference agendas or look at the various seminars that the California Debt and investment Advisory Commission seminars.  All contain useful ideas.  Finally, there is the traditional PA view of financial  management which is basically budgeting and a variety of topics associated with the budget.  there are lots of text books here and ABFM has a section on its web site that has syllabi.\nGood luck!\n\n\nHi Leslie,\nyour question is more complex than it sounds.

It is important to bring to the class the value of visioning, strategic planning, capital reinvestment priorities, performance metrics, innovation initiatives, business philosophy on return of investment, change management requirements if an organization is deciding to reorganize and gain buy-in from staff, and finally, marketing and/or communicating the budget message that sells the value of the investment that is being made for the benefit of the community.  A budget is not just a set of numbers with justification, its a story about where you come from and where you are going.  The better the plot, the better the response to the message it contains.\n\n\nAll good suggestions.  I'd like to add perspective around formulating a budget document.

Are these students taking a required course with no particular interest in the topic or do they come to the course with a firm foundation and are looking for advanced level material. I have been teaching in graduate PA programs for many years and taught Public Budgeting at four universities. my goal was to provide students with the knowledge and skills that an appointing authority would expect a pre-professional to bring to the job, whether that be as an an analyst or a generalist. You can't prepare someone to be a finance director in 10 hours. They need to know the vocabulary, the fundamental concepts, basic tools and a professional perspective. Good luck.\n\n\nLeslie, my suggestion is to first determine who is in the class.
