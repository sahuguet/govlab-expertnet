  "text": "\n\nI'm helping to organize an education session entitled, \"Between a Rock and a Hard Place,\" at Annual Conference.  I'm looking for two or three small community managers coming to Milwaukee who would be willing to present a brief case study on how they facilitated a dialogue between elected officials and citizens on a controversial issue.\nIf you're interested in being a part of this session, please contact me at cfleming@icma.org or call me at 207-854-1083.\n\n",
