  "text": "\n\nI have a member that works in the building Inspection division.  Recently the department took over the mandatory annual inspections for properties around a lake.  These inspections are to safe guard and prevent pollutant that may have the potential of contaminating the waters. \nThere are three main inspections conducted: 1. Boathouses with plumbing; 2. OSSF (Septic Systems); 3. Insecticide Misting System.\nQuestions for local governments that have similar mandatory inspections program:\n\nHow do you conduct these inspections, do you have a process in place that is solid and is working yearly?  Can I have a copy of there process/procedures?\nHow many inspectors do you have assigned and doing these inspections? Do you have just one inspector assigned to conduct inspection annually or several?\nWhat software do you use, to enter inspections, look up, and run reports?\nHow do you contact the property owners?\n\nThanks,\nGreg Stopka, Central Regional Director\nAlliance for innovation\n\n",
