The measures we track include service descriptions (how a department is set up), staffing, inputs, workload (e.g. inspections per year per inspection employee), and performance (e.g. the percent of inspections completed on time, same day, and within 4 calendar days).\nLast year, CPM participants averaged nearly 2,000 inspections per year per full-time equivalent (FTE), and there was considerable variability by jurisdiction size. However, that number is not a \u201cstandard\u201d in anyway, and there are many factors that may suggest to a jurisdiction what staffing they need to provide effective inspection services to their city.\nFor more information about the Center and the types of measures we collect, please contact Rebecca VanRegenmorter at (rvanregenmorter@icma.org; 202-962-3585).\n\n\nCharlotte,\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement collects comparative code enforcement and permitting data annually from our 200-plus participants.

(We have not confirmed that is an ISO criterion.) \nWe recently initiated a contract so that we can supplement in-house inspections with contract inspections to avoid some of the hire/layoff pattern of the past and to more easily flex our inspections capacity on short notice. While we are new to that approach, I imagine there are others with enough experience to share how well that has worked for them.\n\n\nThere are a variety of factors to consider: Travel time between inspections, complexity of construction being inspected (e.g., cookie-cutter residential versus unique non-residential), whether inspectors are cross-trained (so that the same inspector can perform inspections of different types while in the same subdivision), whether they get their assignments electronically without first reporting in each day to a central location, etc. \n\nWhen we compared notes with a neighboring county, we were advised that they faced penalty in their ISO rating for having too many inspections per day per inspector.
