  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have experience with privatizing a municipal airport? Would you suggest a Fixed-Base Operator arrangement?\nThe City of Abilene owns a small, rural airport that includes a runway, taxiway, hangar space, etc. The City is contemplating \"releasing\" all commercial aspects of the airport to a Fixed-Base Operator or a private airport manager. The City would still maintain the physical infrastructure (i.e., runways, taxiways, etc.), but would lease all remaining assets for private management.\nWhat advice would you have on this subject? What considerations would you advise before making this decision? \nDo you have an RFP that could be used to solicit private management of the airport?\nThanks.\n\n",
