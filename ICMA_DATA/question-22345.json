(Visit www.revelstonelabs.com to learn more about our software program.)  Defining the measure--including what it is and what it is not is extremely important.  I would also suggest determining how data is to be collected, as that too can impact the reliability and validity of the data.  As we began our PM program, we held departmental meetings explaining what measures we would be collecting, how they would be collected, and the importance of such measures.  This also gave staff the opportunity to ask questions and give suggestions.  Creating buy-in not only from department heads and supervisors, but also front-line personnel played a huge role in our success.  Remember, building a PM program that is valid and accurate takes time--as well as constantly evaluating the measures, their definitions, and how the data is collected.  This is something that may take a year or more to completely implement as it is more of a change of culture rather than just implementing a new practice.  Best of luck in 2013!\n\n\nThe City of Wyoming uses a cloud-based software program with predefined measures--all of which contribute to valid and reliable data.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Tamarac built our performance management system similar to Wyoming.  We started with building division scorecards which then roll up to department scorecards, and ultimately roll up to a city-wide scorecard.  To build those scorecards we held meetings with staff in each division to help them determine what was important to them to measure.  Each division met at least 5 times - they would meet and then go do research on what others were collecting or how they could collect data in their own areas.  We invited IT to these meetings as often times there was data available but the divisions didn't know it was available or didn't know how to access it.  \nTo determine their performance measures we utilized resources including: 1) Municipal Benchmarks: Assessing local performance and establishing community standards, Third Edition.  By David N. Ammons.  You can order on amazon.com.  Make sure to get the most recent version \u2013 3rd edition copyright 2012;  2)Comparative Performance Measurement data reports from ICMA bookstore; 3) websites of other high performing governments with established performance management systems like Austin TX, Phoenix AZ, Charlotte NC - performance measures for municipalities are usually found through budget office links; and 4) state performance measurement organizations like the Florida Benchmarking Consortium and the North Carolina Benchmarking Project.  \nInvolving staff in determining what they should be collecting ensured buy-in.  We also had them involved in setting the targets, and then linked these performance measures to the budget.  In this way we are streamlining what we collect as well.  We started with a pilot scorecard in public works over two years ago and are only now finishing up with our last department so I agree wholeheartedly with Wyoming that this is a culture change that takes time.  I also think you need to build in processes to ensure the process is sustainable, accurate, consistent.  For us this is monthly department performance reviews, quarterly executive team reviews, alignment with the budget process, and alignment with employee performance evaluations - but of course, you will need to figure out what will work best for your organization.  You are already asking the right questions so it sounds like you are are on track for success.  Good luck!\n\n\nThe City of Tamarac built our performance management system similar to Wyoming.

Through participation in this program each year you have access to measures that have clear definitions and instructions. Participants in the program also have access to CPM staff to ask questions on how data should be reported which ensures accurate data from year to year. In addition, CPM staff run outlier and logic tests on the data that is submitted to make sure that the data is accurate.  Data points are flagged if they don\u2019t meet these checks. Jurisdiction\u2019s then receive a follow up questionnaire with the flagged data points and are asked to verify the data. Working through this program and process ensures that you are collecting useful measures and that the data reported is valid. For more information on our ICMA performance measurement programs please visit our website at icma.org/performance. I am also happy to answer any questions you might have (rvanregenmorter@icma.org; 202-962-3585).\n\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement offers a comparative performance measurement program.

We want to analyze whether the measures are valid (report what is intended), and reliable (consistent, repeatable processes are in place). \nWhat are best practices for performance measure validation? Can anyone share any resources?\nThanks!\n\n",
