The best apps are the ones that are compelling based on need and fit. \nAt a city-level, we have adopted a team approach where all departments are represented but coordinated through one office. There are regular meetings to exchange info and ideas and update where applications are relative to opportunities. The instinct to \"chase\" is still there but our greatest success comes from having a project in mind that is already planned and matching it to an opportunity.\n\n\nYou are in the best position to succeed in securing a grant if you have a project that you need funded rather than just looking to increase your number of grants secured.

Colleges and Universities offer the best transferable mthods for local government in what they refer to as pre-award and post award grants management. Even in a small to medium size community a management analyst or assistant manager could research, apply for, and manage grants. If you wish to consult me on specifics, please contact me at tmcouch@bullochcounty.net and we'll establish a dialogue.\n\n\nDan;s philosophy is correct unless you live in a metro city or HUD entitlement community where you need to do active grants research for CD projects.

We are a midwestern county (pop. ~350,000) and are attempting to increase the number of grants we pursue but there are some concerns about our capacity to properly manage an increased number of grants. I would love to hear about the grant management and grant pursuit frameworks used by others (need not necessarily be county gov't)  Thanks!\n\n",
