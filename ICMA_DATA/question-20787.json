  "text": "\n\nSunnyvale sees an average of 20 special/community events held each year. We define a Special Event as a program or set of activities that is unique or out-of-the norm in nature, requires significant effort to plan and implement, and requires City permits or utilizes City resources. Special events include, but are not limited to:  parades, festivals, street fairs, sidewalk sales, outdoor music concerts, block parties, or athletic events such as runs, walkathons, bicycle races, etc.\nThe City created a process to evaluate these proposed events to facilitate the availability of any required City services or permits. The process includes an internal review by multiple departments of our special event application. Each department provides input on what conditions, if any, should be established for the event (obtaining appropriate permits, paying facility rental fees/deposits, etc.). \nOur City is currently evaluating our process to make it more efficient. We are interested in hearing from folks regarding: \n\u2022 How does your City handle these types of events?\n\u2022 Do you use any software to help you manage the process?\n\u2022 Which department is the lead on this process?\n\u2022 How far in advance does your City require an application/request be submitted?\n\u2022 How much do you charge for processing (application fee)?\n\u2022 What is the average length of time between the time of application and the approval/denial?\nAny information would be great! If you are interested, our website for events can be found at Events.inSunnyvale.com\n\n",
