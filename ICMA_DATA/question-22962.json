  "text": "\n\nThe City of Mason has ran into some issues related to allocating field space to local sports organizations in the city. One of our parks is in high demand for baseball organizations, and we have criteria for what organizations have priority over others to use our fields. However, lower priority organizations have complained that high priority organizations are not using the fields that we have given them for the season and frequently the fields go unused. Does any other jurisdictions have insight or a way that they keep track and hold organizations accountable for the field allocation? Any suggestions would be helpful as well. Thanks!\n\n",
