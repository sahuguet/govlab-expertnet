  "text": "\n\nIn unincorporated Manatee County, FL, we have a large utility service area. We have allowed extensions within this area as long as they built consistent with our utility master plan. However, this area is typically low density (less than 3 du/acre), which in many instances there are very few customers per linear foot for the infrastructure. \nDo you have any criteria with your community's utility extension policies that address:\n- Minimum net density / customers per linear foot\n- Public utility provider getting reimbursed for utility upsizing costs or developer being the at risk party for this reimbursement\n- ROI analysis with specific standards\n- Criteria involve timing of any utility upsizing and future roadway improvements / widening\n- Other criteria\nIn addition, do you have a utility masterplan/model that provides guidance on:\n- Identifies areas of your community that have capacity\n- Ability to run different land use scenarios\n- If so, which model do you use?\nThank you for your assistance.\nJohn Osborne, Planning Official\nManatee County, FL\n\n",
