In addition to the answers you receive, would you mind sharing some of your thoughts and approaches?  I believe the ICMA audience would truly benefit from learning about the adult-to-adult, community (versus purely governmental) approach, interspersed with great \"Peter Block\" approaches to community building, that you have advocated and practiced.  Thanks Ray!!!!\n\n\nHi Ray!  I have heard that you are pretty good at the design and implementation of citizen academies yourself!

      "text": "\n\nHi Ray.  We run a very good program here in Piqua.  In fact, our program was recently recognized by the Ohio City/County Management Association as an award winning Citizen Engagement program.  \nOur program relies heaving on providing once-in-a-lifetime experiences rather than just putting out information.  Our Police Department takes our participants to a laser-gun simulator where we allow residents to fire guns (a participant favorite), our Public Works Department puts up a snow plow obstacle course and our Development Department does a grant writing exercise.  This just a taste of what we do.\nWe have run this program three times and have had 60 people go through the program, not bad for a community of 20,000.\n\n\nHi Ray.
