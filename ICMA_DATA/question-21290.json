Within the City Of Rockville, unlicensed contractors and license professional contractor after being discovered; would be required to pay for a \u201cworking without permit fee\u201d and could also be given a civil citation and associated permitting fee or fee(s).  Further, such individuals could be reported to Maryland Home Improvement Commission (MRIC) or State Fire Marshalls Office (SFMO) for possible disciplinary action against his builder\u2019s license and fire sprinkler installers or other licensing board (plumbers for example) for further investigation. For work without a permit within the City Of Rockville, contractors are required to pay $300.00 in addition to the required fee for initial permitting. Also, there is a $150.00 fee for homeowners conducting work in their own homes, as residential owner builder. \nExcept - fire alarm systems, fire protection systems must be installed, modified and maintained by an individual or company with the appropriate license from the Maryland State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office (SFMO).  Licensed fire protection contractors who are found to be engaged in work without a permit, or work conducted in a negligent manner, can be reported to the SFMO for further investigation.

Safety -- not just revenue -- is generally the chief concern of most code administrator and building departments.
