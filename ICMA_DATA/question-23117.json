One of the goals that has been identified in our business plan is to develop better methods of internal communications.  To this end we are seeking examples of best practices from both publicf and private for methods of internal communication, in particular how major initiatives of the organization are communicated to employees.  If you could take a few minutes to answer the questions below, it would be much apperciated.  \n\nHow does information flow within your organization? (Think about two-way communication instead of just one-way communication.)\nHow many employees do you have in your organization?\nHow are you communicating with employees? (Explain the different methods and how often you are communicating with them utilizing these methods.)\nHow are you building relationships with employees?\nWhat are your approaches for communicating with field vs. office employees? (home office vs. satellite offices)\nWho is responsible for communicating to these employees? \nHow do you measure the program\u2019s success? (measurement tool and how often utilized)\n\nThanks again.\n\n",
