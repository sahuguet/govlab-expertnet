  "text": "\n\nI am looking to put together a policy that allows the Village to promote employees from within to higher level positions.  I would look internally, and then if I did not find anyone internally that fit the bill, then I would post the position externally. \nI had a citizen complain in a public meeting that all positions should be posted because how will we know if we are getting the best candidate if we do not look?  She continued by saying \"people shouldn't just get a job if they were here first.\"   \nWhat is the prevailing opinion on this issue?  What about the ethical issues?   Also what about morale issues for my people who I have been training for years?  Don't I owe it to them to advance their career with training? \nThanks.\n\n",
