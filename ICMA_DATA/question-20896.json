Eventually, we ended up purchasing additional licenses to install MS Office as OpenOffice didn't support the security we were using to lock some excel spreadsheets.\nI think in our situation, it didn't work because we had a mixed environment.  If you would be willing to switch everyone to OpenOffice, I think you would have more success.  Just make sure that your power users are still able to do everything that they can currently do in MS Office.  Sorry I don't have a better answer for you, but maybe someone else does.\nPS - The newer version of OpenOffice may work better now, but since we already purchased the MS Office licenses, we don't have a need to test it.\n\n\nA couple of years ago we used OpenOffice on a few computers for about a year.

What didn't work was our lack of training; none of the users were given training on OO over MS Office.  Had we done that, it may have succeeded.  Definitely TRAIN on the software you are implementing.\n\n\nIn building a new Police Department of 40 members, I tried to implement OpenOffice.

Unfortunately, Microsoft Publisher makes everything they do proprietary so NO other program can use those files.  As for password protection, you can set passwords on OpenOffice documents when you save the file.  Once again unfortunately, Microsoft makes the software they use to password protect files proprietary so if a file has been protected while a Microsoft document, NO other software will be able to utilize that file.
