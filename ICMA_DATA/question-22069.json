Additionally, I recommend that you don't focus too much on the specific job itself, which may mean accepting a job that is not in the City Manager's office.  Get your foot in the door first so that you can show them your knowledge, talents, and work ethic.  Also, try to find a quality organization that is high-performing, wins awards, and has a good reputation.  If you're going to spend your time building your career in one organization, you want it to be a good one that you'll be happy in and will provide opportunities for you.  My first job was as a Code Enforcement Officer, certainly not my career goal, but it got my foot in the door.  Less than four years later, I was the Planning & Development Director for the same organization and my career has continued to grow since then.  Good luck!\n\n\nAndrew's advice is all good and I echo it.

      "text": "\n\nTom, I can tell from your resume that you have a lot of great government experience.\nThat being said, I think your career search would benefit from a paring down of your resume. This may seem like a difficult and daunting task, but there is a useful method you can employ to do so. I know this may seem like very obvious advice, but it has been one of the most important career search suggestions I've ever received, and I'll pass it on: Tailor your resume for the specific position you are applying for. This means that you'll have to revise your resume for each job you apply to, but it will really help you present yourself the way your potential employer will like to see you. This will also help you eliminate details from your resume that are most likely impressive though extraneous to the main goal of any resume review: to get an interview.\nSuch a process will inevitably result in a \u201ctheme\u201d for your resume. You can find such a theme by taking key words (especially verbs) from the job descriptions you\u2019re applying for. Make it easy for an employer to make the decision to interview you. If the employer is seeking an analyst to \u201cdevelop and monitor performance of department budgets,\u201d your resume should mention job details where you \u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cmonitored.\u201d Again, make it easy for the employer to schedule that interview; don\u2019t make him hunt around your resume for signs you\u2019re qualified.\nJessica\u2019s advice about searching out quality organizations is excellent. Even if you can\u2019t snag a job in the manager\u2019s office, you\u2019ll be exposed to a high-functioning organization that values talent and passion for local government. Choose to apply for positions that include an analytical, organization-wide focus rather than those that are purely operationally-focused. For example, a management analyst position within a police department could expose you to more organization-wide objectives and goals than a budget technician position in a budget office; though the budget office may have more direct links to the manager\u2019s office, it may not offer you the right kind of exposure you\u2019ll need. If you\u2019re looking for a future in local government management, it\u2019s important to see how local government works at both the small- and large-scale levels.\nBest of luck!\n\n\nTom, I can tell from your resume that you have a lot of great government experience.\n\nThat being said, I think your career search would benefit from a paring down of your resume.

I recommend creating a LinkedIn profile to reflect the experience in your resume because it is ranked highly in Web search results. Because relatively few ICMA members use LinkedIn at this stage (around 15% by my sampling of known members), you'll be seen as an \"early adopter\" and savvy with social media. Once on LinkedIn, you can join the online equivalents of offline groups such as ICMA and then send connection requests to fellow group members -- quite handy for networking.\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/joeohlerjr\n\n\nI am a fellow under-utilized MPA graduate who has been doing the \"right things\" without the results to show for it, much like you.

Tailor your resume to each job.  Your resume is difficult to catch your most significant accomplishments.  I know it is difficult to pair one's resume down but it is necessary.  Career summaries, notable achievements, testimonials, list of skills and lengthy description of activities under education are not necessary.  As an employer I'm really looking for what sets you apart at your last job assignment. \nIf I may suggest please check out the \"Manager Tools\" website.

You, or Tom, or anyone cannot expect to get \"lucky\" and walk into a top position just because you are educated.

My first job was as a Town Clerk which became an Assistant Town Manager position when I showed what I could do.  My second job I stepped down in a larger city as an Assistant Personnel Director before the City Manager saw my potential and made me an Assistant City Manager.  It may take charisma and it may take talent but you have to be showcased for either of those to make a difference.  Tom, set your sights lower and work your way up.
