You can read the article about their successes here (http://icma.org/en/Article/11771/Santa_Monica_CA__Citys_Homelessness_Initiative_Leads_to_an_8_Reduction).\nI also saw a question that was answered last year, but may lead you to resources that will help with your information gathering. You can see it here (http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/question/21656).\nHomeless Solutions responded to an RFP from Dayton, OH with a proposal for ending vagrancy in the city over ten years.  See their plan here (http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/question/21656).\nThe City of Norfolk, VA was able to end homelessness for some by establishing a permanent supportive housing unit in the city. You can read an article about their success here (http://icma.org/en/Article/10040/Norfolk_VA_Strives_to_End_Homelessness).\nYou may have luck looking for more information on dealing with vagrancy if you search the Knowledge Network for articles and documents that have the Public Health, Public Safety, and Housing topic tags.\nI hope this helps.\nBest,\nJames Davidson\nKnowledge Network Intern\n\n\nHi Pam,\nIn turning to the Knowledge Network to look for sources, I found a bunch of great articles and documents that discuss methods for dealing with vagrancy.\nSanta Monica, CA recently achieved an 8% reduction in homeless numbers through a couple of major initiatives.
