Diversification of revenues vary by type of government as well as between states because of differences in the authorization given to local governments as well as home rule implications for some governments that others do not have. Heavy reliance on property taxes is common. \nWhen I taught revenue analysis, my focus on diversification was in regard to the characteristics of different revenues or -- in the case of your question -- different taxes. Balancing a portfolio between taxes that peak and bottom out at different points in an economic cycle (e.g., sales taxes are more reactive to the economy and generally peak earlier than property taxes) and that have different levels of stability versus variability is important. Diversity is best measured in terms of the characteristics of the overall revenue portfolio -- similar to how one evaluates the overall peformance of an investment portfolio.\nOne option would be to benchmark against similar governments within your state -- i.e., examine their composition of taxes and other revenues and see how they historically faired. That takes out differences across state lines in how state governments (or constitutions) impact the revenue options available to local governments.\n\n\nI will be interested to see what other answers you receive but I think the answer is no.

  "text": "\n\nA locality is curious if anyone knows of a common tax profile for local governments that would break down the percentages of revenue from property taxes, BPOL, meals, telecommunications, recordation, motor vehicles, etc.  Is there a common tax diversification profile?\nThank you for your assistance.\n\n",
