  "text": "\n\nHello. My name is David Rauch, a graduate student at Northern Illinois University. I am interested in finding examples of jointly-contracted maintenance services initiated at the local level. The Village of Glenview, IL has a program called the Municipal Partnering Initiative (MPI) in which 18 communities pool their resources and together contract road resurfacing, crack sealing, sewer lining, and more.\nDoes anyone have similar examples of programs like the MPI? I am interested in writing a masters dissertation on the relative cost-savings of municipalities participating in this kind of venture, and I'd like a comparison program.\nMy email is drauch@downers.us and I look forward to hearing from you.\nDavid R\n\n",
