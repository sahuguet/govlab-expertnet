  "text": "\n\nHello. I would like to know if any professionals have used or have knowledge about the procurement bid process software called \"Plant Bids\". I was conducting some research for my Department and I noticed that 4/5 cities used Planet Bids for their bid process. I am having difficulty finding any information about it so I thought I would turn to my fellow ICMA Members for possible help. Thank you!\n\n",
