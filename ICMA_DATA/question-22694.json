  "text": "\n\nMy city recently had an issue concerning the publication of a press release concerning the settlement of contentious litigation. Without getting into too many details, the cause of the litigation involved a 3-2 council vote and the issue is still hot-button. Our Communications Department disseminates about 10 press releases a week mostly about innocuous city events. \nMy question is if other municipalities have an established policy addressing what topics the City/County Manager can and cannot publish a press release concerning? Is litigation excluded specifically, or does the policy have a more broad \"sensitive topics\" exclusion? Does your municipality differentiate among releases from the City Manager, the Council/Commission, and individual Councilors/Commissioners?\n\n",
