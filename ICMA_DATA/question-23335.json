I served as construction counsel, helping project teams develop and administer procurement processes for a wide variety of public contracts, where innovation was necessary and expected.  Then, I left the public sector and went to private industry, where I learned how much I didn't know about private industry.  With all due respect to my public sector colleagues, I came to realize that many public sector employees do not truly understand or appreciate private industry challenges and thus, these employees don't know how, or are not motivated, to design procurement processes that get the best ideas from the private sector.  The private sector is happy to provide input on how the two sectors can work together collaboratively and cost effectively.  There is no silver bullet to the perfect solution - some ideas will work well in some areas and some ideas won't, due to differences in regulatory structure, political will and operational realities.  I suggest you convene one or more focus groups of private and public sector  folks from your local area to talk about how you, as the public sector, can frame procurements processes that will allow the private sector to come forward with their most innovative and cost effective ideas.  You will be amazed at the ideas, which are generated.  As a side benefit, you will lay the foundation for your agency to be perceived as open-minded and transparent - the owner of choice for the private sector.  Then, you will have the private sector beating your door down to bring you their best ideas.\n\n\nDear Emily,  I was a public sector employee for over 25 years working for public agencies that built large infrastructure projects.

Have you issued a Request for Solutions?\n\n",
