Many communities no longer have an Assistant to the City Manager or offer paid internship programs. Positions like mine seem to be dying out.

I have developed a survey targeted at managers or others in public administration with fewer than 10 years experience, and I hope that readers in that category could take the time to take the completely anonymous (and not invasive) survey. The link is below.\nhttp://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1760279/Capstone-Survey-to-Young-Managers\nAnd please feel free to pass on the link to others who may not see this message on Knowledge Network.\nMany thanks!\nJessie Levine\n\n",
