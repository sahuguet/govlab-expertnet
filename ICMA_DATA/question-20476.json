It is my opinion that Parks and general government maintenance can be successful either combined or separate.  Parks has many grounds-related maintenance tasks that relate directly to the operation of a park that generally to not translate to maintenance of general government buildings.  Having crews that can sweep parking lots, take care of ball fields, and assist with special events in a park...who can then at other times repair shelters and handle trash...seems to work well under parks supervision.  On the other hand, maintenance of HVAC systems in year-round buildings may be better handled by a larger Maintenance department.  In the past 2 years we formed a hybrid version, where our general government Maintenance department has responsbility for HVAC, plumbing and electrical in our parks, but parks maintenance staff handle carpentry, painting and custodial.  In Frederick County the Parks Division is also responsible for groundskeeping and snow removal at all general government properties as well as for Parks.  Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss in more detail.

The example relates specifically to consolidation of snow removal resources, but could definitely be applied to maintenance more generally. The case is attached here.

That is, some cities have maintenance divisions under Parks & Rec and under Public Works, etc.    \n1)  Do you have one department that handles all maintenance?    \n2)  If so, which department it is in?  \n3)  Do you have any insights you can share re: pros/cons of one department or multiple maintenance divisions?  \nYour time and expertise are appreciated!    \nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n1-888-468-6450\nPmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
