What I have seen it is perhaps more a demographic - when at Vancouver we knew we were nearly 80% personnel costs, but that doesn't say a lot except maybe the cost of our organized labor may be relatively high.\nBTW, we used overtime goals of under 5% of total personnel costs for Fire, Police and Public Works. With active management, it worked very well. (but had to watch comp time to make sure it didn't pop up)\n\n\nPaul, it sounds like you are interested in it as a benchmarkable measure or possibly a performance indicator.

      "text": "\n\nRecently, we computed personnel costs as a percent of General Fund expenditure for 11 DFW-Area cities.  We relied on CAFR and Annual Budget documents, which would also be good sources for total expenditure.  Of course, Mr. Allison is correct that because some programs are more capital-intensive than others, any city-level comparison is unlikely to yield perfectly comparable cases.  Still, by excluding other funds, we thought we might approximate this better.  For the 3 years we collected, the range was between 58.9% to 81.1%.  Since that lower-bound was the last year, and the 81.1 returned to 80.5, I'd say lower 60s to lower 80s are probably a safer approximation.\n\n\nRecently, we computed personnel costs as a percent of General Fund expenditure for 11 DFW-Area cities.

How goverments budget those can vary from within fund in enterprise operations to separate Capital funds. That makes comparisons between governments problematical.\nAnother measure is to look at the average personnel costs per FTE. That has the advantage of providing fairly comparable data as FTE counts rise and fall, and allows comparisons within government  between units to track the relative costs of staff. It gives a handy way to rationally ballpark the cost of adding staff in a given unit.\nTotal personnel costs/ Total budgeted FTE = Cost per FTE is a simple way using numbers that are easily available. It's fairly simple to go back 10 years using budgets and CAFR's to build a historical database. You can use adjustments such as including/excluding things like overtime and temp employees to generate multiple values. In a perfect world, adding staff should reduce overtime. Does it?\nNo metric is perfect, but no matter what you are doing to manage costs, if your average cost per FTE continues to rise on a slope that exceeds your increase in income, you will likely be in for trouble at some point in the future.\n\n\nLarge capital expenditures, or lack thereof, can easily move percentage of total cost numbers for any subset.

I've always heard the average is somewhere between 75% and 90% but I can't seem to find the data anywhere. Does anyone know where something like this is published so that I can get my hands on it?\nThanks\n\n",
