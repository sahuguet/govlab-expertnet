However, it sounds like you might want to consider posting a job in the jobs section of the knowledge network (http://icma.org/en/icma/career_network/job_seekers/browse_jobs) to see if you can find someone who has knowledge in that area to work remotely with you to develop your training program. Another option would be ask this question in the sustainability group and see if the experts have anything to say about this up and coming topic of interest. I hope that once you do develop your program you post it on ICMA\u2019s Knowledge Network because this is a great innovative and forward thinking program idea. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern\nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Alex, \nUnfortunately we do not have any documents specific to training programs for eco-driving.

  "text": "\n\nHello everyone, I'm Alex Rivera with the City of Phoenix's Fleet Services Division. We're looking into training for our employees to drive eco-friendly. I've found a number of resources, but we're looking more for someone to assist us in developing a training program and allowing us to administer it, rather than having the training provided to us or using a pre-made training program. Has any local government developed such a training program? I came across Polk County, FL doing something similar in 2009, but haven't seen anything since. Thanks in advance for your assistance.\n\n",
