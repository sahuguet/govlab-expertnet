  "text": "\n\nThe City of Tempe is searching for information on how other cities quantify graffiti in their community in regard to tracking, measuring/charting the existing amount and condition assessment.  Do you do annual assessments?  If so, does it include only what can be seen from roadways?  We are looking beyond just a tracking report for how much graffiti is abated each year.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Please contact me for questions.\n\n",
