  "text": "\n\nI am curious to see how some municipalities write policy memos. I am hopeful individuals will be able to provide me with some differing sample memos as I try to develop a template for a memo relative to management issues/operational service delivery.\nIdeally, I would like to see if there are standard categories/questions/subtitles you require addressed including the preferred length of a memo.\nThis memo may come from a budget analyst/project manager/department head to the Town Manager.\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.\nKindest regards,\nTim C.\n\n",
