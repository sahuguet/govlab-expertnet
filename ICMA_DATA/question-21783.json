Generally, jurisdictions will provide a rough estimate as this data is difficult to collect in heavily wooded areas.  For FY2012, CPM is considering eliminating the tree count questions from our survey as it is difficult to collect and frequently left blank by jurisdictions.

  "text": "\n\nLooking for advice on how other cities/counties conducted their tree inventory for the ICMA Forestry Performance Measurements.  We have pretty good GPS/GIS inventory of trees for downtown areas and most of our neighborhood and community parks.  However, along our trails and regional parks where the tree canopy covers several hundred acres,  the counting of individual trees that are maintained and pruned  is problematic. \nWe could just go with our existing inventory, but then that doesn't count the tree work that we do when limbs or trees fall across trails or when we have to raise the canopy along the trails. \nThanks for your help.\n\n",
