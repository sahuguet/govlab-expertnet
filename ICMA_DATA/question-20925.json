  "text": "\n\nHello,\nAs we all know, economic challenges have brought two subjects a lot of attention lately: procurement and cloud-based computing. it seems that local governments are recognizing procurement practices represent a significant cost-savings opportunity. And cloud-based services represent lower expenses and less IT management.\nIt seems like the hurdle for these procurement departments to take advantage of eProcurement is the perceived entry cost and understanding of the many layers of short and long-term savings.\nI'm curious to know if anyone thinks these departments would benefit from or be inspired by guidance on making a compelling business case to power their potential desire for eProcurement software?\ni appreciate your response.\n\n",
