  "text": "\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale, FL is in the process of developing a photographic, multi-attribute rating scale to evaluate the level of landscaping/maintenance performed at City parks and on medians. Ideally, we would like to be able to tie this maintenance level/rating to a dollar amount that can be used to communicate both the cost of increased landscaping/maintenance activities and the impact of funding cuts to the appearance of parks and medians. For example, our current mowing cycles for medians are done by a contractor but due to budget reductions the \"density\" of the medians has decreased (meaning the medians don't have as many flowers, hedges, shrubbery, signage, etc.). There is a desire to be able to communicate what a manicured landscape would look like and associated maintenance costs. Additionally, there is a desire to communicate the level of service (i.e. appearance) that could be expected if funding is cut. \nIf your organization has any type of scale used to evaluate landscaping we would appreciate if you shared it with us, and even more if you could take a moment to discuss the developmental process that went into it. Any information or advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance! \nSarah Saunders, Performance Analyst\nssaunders@fortlauderdale.gov\n954-828-5131\n\n",
