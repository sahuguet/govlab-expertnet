  "text": "\n\nIn a recent article from the Michigan Messenger (available here: http://michiganmessenger.com/38332/mine-opponents-to-deliver-environmental-justice-petition-in-lansing), we are told of the recent problems in the Upper Peninsula of MI regarding an intended commercial mine that is to be built upon lands, the access to which was given to a local Native American community an agreement with Michigan.  The state has leased the land to a private company to install the mine, on the grounds that the Native American ceremonial religious site on those grounds does not qualify as a \u201creligious institution\u201d as it does not have a building (which would make it be protected under state law).  Citizens from that region and many surrounding localities are protesting in Lansing, MI, strongly in favor of the Native Americans\u2019 rights to continue to access their ceremonial site.  To complicate matters, the Michigan Environmental Justice Plan is in draft format still (available on the Knowledge Network here: http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/301322/Michigan_Environmental_Justice_Plan__Draft), and its outcome could be affected by the way this situation plays out.\nWhat do you think should be done in this specific instance?  Of equal importance, what are the implications of this for your local government?  If the state made an agreement with citizens (in this instance, Native Americans, but generally any group of citizen) in your local area regarding environmental justice concerns, how should local government be involved?\n\n",
