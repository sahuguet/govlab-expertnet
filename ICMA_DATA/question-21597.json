      "text": "\n\nHello Eric. If you have the space and time, a brainstorming session format could be very productive. Start with participants in groups. If there are some major categories you could begin with, place one category at each table and let people sit where they choose. Have each table brainstorm specifics about their category onto chart paper. If there is time, do a table swap and add ideas. Take all the ideas, consolidate similar ideas, then ask participants to \"vote\" for their favorites by placing colored dots next to the (2-3) ideas they like best.  \nThis is a very general explanation. If you are interested, I will certainly provide better details.\n\n\nHello Eric. If you have the space and time, a brainstorming session format could be very productive.

      "text": "\n\nA variation of Kathleen's suggestion is to use an \"Open Space\" format that will allow the attendees to define the day's agenda rather than you defining the agenda. You will need a large room to do this exercise and perhaps addtional smaller rooms as well.  First, welcome attendees and explain the process you will use (see below) to invite their ideas. Second, implement the process as follows: (1) invite any participant to offer a question or issue that motivated them to attend the meeting;  (2) after hearing from attendees, then invite any attendee to take paper from one of the  flip charts you've made available and use markers you provided to write down a question or topic; (3) ask the attendees to tape their paper on the walls around the room; (4) ask attendees to move around the room looking at the topics/questions raised and discussing the topics/questions; (5) have attendees vote on the topics/questions they think should be the focus of the day's work; (6) Choose the top five or six or seven topics - assign those topics to a table or to a room and invite attendees to go to the table or room that interests them in order to brainstorm solutions.  Ask for a volunteer at each table or room to document ideas.  At the end of the session have a volunteer report on the progress for each table or room.  I've oultined the basic ideas in a 'Open Space\" approach - so you can adapt to your circmustances if you find the suggestion useful.\n\n\nA variation of Kathleen's suggestion is to use an \"Open Space\" format that will allow the attendees to define the day's agenda rather than you defining the agenda.

      "text": "\n\nI agree with Kathleen that brainstorming and the affinity diagram exercise followed by multivoting works well -- particularly when time is short. Keep the groups smallish (no more than 10 each). You could use broad categories for people to work in (e.g. parks, open space, recreation facilities, recreation programs, etc.). You need to consider the \"convening question\" you will employ to initiate the brainstorming with -- i.e. \"What outcomes should we achieve with our community recreation dollars?\", \"What kinds of programs would you like to see?\", \"Who are we trying to serve with our recreation programs\" -- find the right question to ask in order for the brainstorming to give you the answer you are looking for.\nIf you have more time I have used the following series of brainstormed questions and list creations to guide towards a plan of action -- these lists build on each other and help the participants see the reason they move from one to the next: \nUsing community recreation as the focus (1) What are the \"facts\" as you believe them regarding our community recreation efforts? (2) Looking at that list of facts, what conclusions or premises do I draw from those facts? (3) Based on those premises, what issues must we deal with in order to be successful?, (4) what objective do I seek in order to deal with the issue, how do I measure that goal?, (5) What strategy or strategies should I employ in order to \u201cmake\u201d my Goal and achieve the Objective?, (6) what resources are required to do those things and who will be tasked with doing them. I have attached a flow chart of that . . . you can vary the depth of the conversations and who is involved as you move from Issues to Goals to Action Steps -- it's just a variation of brainstorming.\n\n\nI agree with Kathleen that brainstorming and the affinity diagram exercise followed by multivoting works well -- particularly when time is short.
