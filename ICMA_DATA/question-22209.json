It did a great job of pulling together information from Word, Excel, and our ERP system to create budget book pages (take a look at the finished product on the Budget Division site on www.Broward.org). PatternStream makes it sound really easy on their website, but eventually the Budget Division hired a full time Tech person to help us with all of our issues in creating budget book pages during budget season. So, unless they have improved the technology signifiacntly, you'll need someone who is an IT guru to help you with issues. But, I've been gone from there since 2009, so it might be totally different now.\nHope that helps. If you find better software, I'd be interested in knowing.\nThanks,\nAlan\n\n\nThe closest I've seen is something called PatternStream http://www.patternstream.com/\nNot sure if they still do, but it was used in Broward County, Florida to prepare our budget book.

  "text": "\n\nWondering if anyone has budgeting software that not only allows for the input and tracking of the budget, but also aides in the generation of a Budget Book for public dissemination.\nIdeally, the software would be able to create tables and graphs with consistent formatting that update automatically. \nDoes anyone have any experience with using a budget software to generate a budget document such as this? \nThanks!\n\n",
