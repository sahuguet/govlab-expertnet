      "text": "\n\nHi Melissa,\nFree speech and right of free expression is a clear cut issue when it comes to government regulation in general.  With regard to public schools the courts have upheld a very very small amount of regulation by the school on student expression (largely when they could show that it would substantially disrupt school activities).  In local government we have no option to select what ideas or expressions are made when we open up a public forum. I would argue that a city sponsored public facebook page is analagous to a city council meeting or any other public forum.  Until this type of issue is vetted through the court system, I believe all ideas and expressions must be allowed regardless of content.   However, as the previous post states above, I think you could set some uniform guidelines for public postings (eg remove all posts after a certain period of time; similar to time limiting public comment at a public meeting).  We have dealt with this issue on our facebook page as well.  Typically the discourse is civil but is self regulated by other members' knowledge of who is making the comment.  It has always not lasted long and died on its own without our intervention.   I would suspect  the person that is posting on your facebook page is soliciting your regluation which would in turn provide ammunition for this person to publicly vilify the city.  As I am finding along my career path in local government, in some cases, I think the best thing would be to do nothing.   You can't lose if you don't play the game.  If you feel compelled you may want to simply post a disclaimer regarding the removal of libelous and/or extremenly offensive comments.  I am not an attorney nor am I giving legal advice..these are simply my thoughts based on experience.\nBelow are some excerpts from Supreme Court cases which dealt with First Amendment Issues.  Before you do anything you should consult your city attorney. \n\"the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content\"\n\"Under Equal Protection Clause, government may not grant use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views; government may not select which issues are worth discussing or debating in public facilities\"\n\"There is an equality of status in the field of ideas, and government must afford all points of view an equal opportunity to be heard; once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some groups, government may not prohibit others from assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intend to say; selective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone\"\n\n\nHi Melissa,\n\nFree speech and right of free expression is a clear cut issue when it comes to government regulation in general.

  "text": "\n\nHere in Chalfont Borough we have a Youth Committee Facebook Page where we post up coming events, pictures from those events, and related news stories.  We currently have over 100 fans of the page, and allow two-way communication.  Residents can post their own comments on the page or comment directly on our posts.  \nUnfortunately, we have one resident who is using this page as his own personal political sounding board.  His language is clean but the content is, let's just say, not nice for a page geared to the youth of the community.  I feel I have two options - either block him from the page and face a First Amendment Rights violation lawsuit, or I block all two-way communication from the page entirely.   \nHas anyone had any experience with something similar?  Thank you for any feedback and assistance.\n\n",
