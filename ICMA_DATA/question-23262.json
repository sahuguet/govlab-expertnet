  "text": "\n\nWorking with your local farmers' market? Updating your zoning to allow for new grocery stores, urban chickens, or rooftop bees? Procuring only locally grown foods in municipal buildings? Providing curbside composting?\nICMA's Center for Sustainable Communities is writing a series of case studies highlighting the variety of different efforts local governments have undertaken to strengthen their local food economy and food systems, and to address issues of food access and insecurity. If you're interested in being profiled, please contact Abigail Lundy (alundy@icma.org) with a brief email outlining the efforts you're involved with.\nHope to hear from many of you!
