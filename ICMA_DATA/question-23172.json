  "text": "\n\nHas your community or region engaged consultants to perform population projection studies? Looking for something more comprehensive than just the traditional school population studies. Ideally the data would look at future growth or decline in population; changing demographics by age, race, etc., Looking to develop and use the data on a community-wide basis to help plan for changing demands for service including but not limited to education, parks & recreation, public safety, transportation, etc.\nThanks,\nBob Kiely\nCity Manager\nLake Forest, IL\n\n",
