  "text": "\n\nA member is about to embark on a Comp Plan update and as part of that process, is looking for successful infill or redevelopment projects from typical suburban zoning to higher density/mixed use development.  They are specifically looking for suburban areas, leaning more toward infill and redevelopment and less large-scale, new development.  Please send any good examples of land-use overhaul my way. \nThanks,\nGreg Stopka, Central Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n\n",
