  "text": "\n\nI have been asked to start a Marketing Team comprised of representatives from our various County departments. This team would help to identify citizen-focused, newsworthy ideas that I would then use for news releases, the website, social media posts, newsletters, etc. As an organization without an official Marketing Department, I am looking for ideas on the best way to go about organizing this team. Any suggestions? Has anyone had success with a similar setup?\n\n",
