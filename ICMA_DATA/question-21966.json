  "text": "\n\nJust read Emily Elledge's interesting post about the City of Roanoke's cool Green Roof (http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/blogs/blogpost/704/Green_Roofs)  and the building of \"green walls\" in Mexico.  I would love to hear about other  ICMA members and  KN users who have installed green roofs!  Let us know so we can share here and on our new CityLinks website - icma.org/citylinks.\n\n",
