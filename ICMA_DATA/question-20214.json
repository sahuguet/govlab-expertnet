  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance member is looking to expand it's \"Employee Suggestion\" program.  They are interested in learning if any other local governments that have implemented a \"Citizen Suggestion\" type program.  And, what rewards they might receive. \nCurrently, employees get a percentage of real dollar savings from suggestions or a flat \"reward\" dollar amount for efficiencies or process improvements.\nCopies of your Citizen and/or Employee Suggestion Programs would be helpful!\nThank you,\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450\npmuse@transformgov.org\nwww.transformgov.org\n\n",
