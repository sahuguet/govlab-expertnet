Unfortunately we do not have anything directly addressing pedal pubs yet on the Knowledge Network although I'm sure as they grow in popularity we will start getting resources. I was able to find a previously asked question that deals with open container laws and outdoor patio seating. Your city may be able to count the pedal pubs in a similar way to bar patios. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/kn/Question/21928\nI hope your member finds this useful and that when they create their own plan they add it to the Knowledge Network!\nBest, \nRobin Saywitz\nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Gregory, \n\nThis sounds like a pretty new business!
