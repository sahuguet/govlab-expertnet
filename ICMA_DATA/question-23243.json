      "text": "\n\nThanks very much Mr. Morton. Even without parameters, you've pointed me to a very helpful analysis- esp the survey questions to departments (appendix 1), the space standards (appendix 2) and the  various forecast scenarios. The overview pieces are also helpful for me in explaining to others that we are just at the beginning of a process- determining needs, not yet how to address them. The parameters for us FYI are to accommodate currently about 200 administrative staff (e.g., finance, clerks, planning, engineering, corp services) as opposed to operational, fire or parks and rec). Also need to accomodate council. Space needs to accommodate a range of transactional (e.g., tax payments), advisory (planning and building) and ceremonial services (council meetings, weddings) for the public and a host of internal services (HR, accounting, IT, purchasing). We serve 90,000 people and are looking at our needs out to 2031 when we anticipate 130,000 pop.  So those are the basic parameters. So your example is right on the money in terms of what I am looking for. Thank you very much. Curry\n\n\nThanks very much Mr. Morton.

  "text": "\n\nI am looking to find the methodology/questions that municipalities ask when determining their office space needs.\nI realize that this is typically done by a consultant (usually an architect) but in our case, I (who am not) have been asked. I've scoped the project to just deal with needs, not how to address them. We're really talking about starting from a clean slate where the municipality needs to determine overall what its office space needs are and what methodology is used to arrive at the answer. Any tools (e.g., excel spreadsheets to insert forecasts) would be most appreciated\n\n",
