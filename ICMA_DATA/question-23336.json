  "text": "\n\nHello! We are looking at revamping our New Employee Orientations. The City of Topeka has over 1100 employees and is a full-service city, so we have frequent orientations with diverse crowds--everyone from police officers to street crews to management. Does anyone have a new employee orientation model you believe works very well? Please send schedules and thoughts on what works and what doesn't.  We are also looking at integrating some kind of mentorship program for new employees if anyone has an example of that. Thank you!\n\n",
