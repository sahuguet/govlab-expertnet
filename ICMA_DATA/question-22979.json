  "text": "\n\nI am working with ICMA\u2019s Center for Sustainable Communities to develop a compendium of local government polices and practice that support people aging in their own homes or communities.\nWe would love to share your success stories in the compilation. If your community has implemented policies that encourage aging in place or create livable communities for all ages, please contact me at susangrobinson@gmail.com or leave a note in the comments below so that I can follow up with you. Policies will be organized by content areas, including (but not limited to) strategic and financial planning; land use; transportation; housing; the village movement; and emergency management.\n\n",
