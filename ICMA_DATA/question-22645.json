  "text": "\n\nHello: \nThe City of Virginia Beach Storm Water Utility has two primary areas \u2013 Project Management and Operations, though there is some overlap (e.g., some small projects can be managed by Operations). When a request is generated (by City Council or upper level staff) that involves improvements to the existing storm water system, sometimes those requests are directed to the Project Management staff and at other times they are directed to Operations staff. Both areas are staffed by engineers who can handle the requests.\nDoes any locality have Storm Water Utility SOP\u2019s that address how requests, such as improvements to the current system, are to be assigned within the Utility (Project Management vs. Operations)?\nIf you can assist, please email me at muniref@vbgov.com \nMany thanks. \nStephanie\n\n",
