The CM should lead a team that includes Finance/Budget, Public Works/Engineering, Facilities Management, Parks & Recreation, Safety Services, utilities (if they are separate from Public Works),  and Economic Develop/Planning.  The team could be labeled the Capital Prioritization Committee (CPC) with the understanding that this committee represents the foundation for developing a broader asset management program.\nAt the first meeting or two, the CPC would need to adopt a mission statement, short and long term goals, and performance metrics that can allow the CM to monitor progress against the selected goal(s) and his/her expected outcome.  This process is best facilitated by someone who understands the planned outcomes and can serve to guide the Committee throughout the initial process.  \nThe next requirement is to identify what the organization considers a capital project.  Normally assets valued above a certain value or a bundle of assets which exceed that value normally would be repaired, replaced or rehabilitated as a unit or project would be prioritized and funded as a capital item.  Those that fall below the value benchmark would be considered operations and maintenance expenditures and repairs/replacements would be funded using annually budgeted maintenance dollars.  \nYou next have to decide if you want to rate assets or projects.  This is where having your horizontal assets housed in a geographic information system (GIS) and/or vertical assets on a computerized maintenance management system would be of use.  Also, having a detailed listing of assets in a hierarchical format also allows the CPC to evaluate groups of like assets and rate them as a whole or individually based on age, type, category, area, location or whatever.  Assets can be bundled into projects whereas projects may need to be unbundled to rate key assets.\nAnother point of interest following the asset/project discussion is one of the benefits of capital prioritization.  The old way of deciding capital projects is to look at what major assets need repair (i.e., a pumping station, so many linear feet of stormwater conveyance pipeline and catchbasins, all the traffic control cabinets on a selected major arterial, and so on).   These whole systems became a project.  With capital prioritization being an element of a broader asset management strategy, the process of selection gets more refined.   Essentially, capital infrastructure needing repair pulls apart this old way of looking at projects and looks to elements or major components of a project so that strategic decisions of what truly needs repair can be identified, rebundled and funded.  This allows funding to be spread to a broader set of physical assets designated as critical.  Therefore, a pumping station may only require a new motor control center and not the whole station upgraded.  The stormwater main, based on televising, may have joint leakage problems and root removal needs requiring grouting and may not require large sections of main replacement or manhole repairs. \nAlso, since you are considering making the selection of asset repairs and improvements a more deliberative process, you may also want to consider creating a renewal and replacement reserve for key component rehabilitation and not necessarily the entire asset replacement since the latter may qualify as a capital expense.  This essentially funds interim major repairs until the asset\u2019s useful life is reached and replacement is required.  This begins to shift your maintenance plans into a preventive maintenance mode rather than waiting for assets to fail or run to failure.\nOkay, now you are getting down to the actual prioritization process.  Examples of criticality of failure (severity) and probability of failure (condition) can easily be found in the International Asset Management Manual.  Each community establishes their own criteria for each.  Criteria values can be weighted or not.  Performance criteria can be added as well.  Criteria should be adjusted or modified to reflect the major category of assets you are dealing with.  For example, roads, bridges, traffic control, water, sewer, storm, buildings, parks, solid waste, golf courses, light rail and airports should have different regulatory requirements, safety expectations, economic impacts, and public expectations.\nOnce scoring is done, the CPC then needs to decide how to interpret the results of the highest to lowest ranked assets or projects.  The most expensive project may be the highest priority but that may draw to much of the total funding away from the larger pool of need.  So, there is a conversation needed to balance the cost benefit of expensive projects against those less expensive.\nHopefully, this provides some perspective and an outline of elements that consider including to create a prioritization strategy.  \nBill Gilmore\nWilliam B.
