  "text": "\n\n\nHow can you effectively track and compare programs where the results are only clear many years later?\nIs workload important, or should measures focus on quality or processing time?\n\nICMA is interested in your opinions of what housing, health, human services, and sustainability measures work best and which are most meaningful to city/county managers in comparing your performance to that of other jurisdictions.\nOver the last 12 months, ICMA has been conducting significant evaluation, research, and design efforts to restructure its performance management activities and facilitate the analysis of just such issues.  High level changes include: \n1.  Streamlined service areas and a focus on core and outcome measures, shifting the data collection burden from roughly 5,000 individual measures to 500\n2.  New, state of the art software platform with improved reporting and analytic capabilities\n3.  New service levels that appropriately focus on the performance management and analytic activities undertaken by your community and provide a clear course for development\nTo inform our survey update efforts, ICMA has created short-term task forces on this and other service clusters to ensure that we build our revised performance management program on the metrics most relevant and meaningful to local government decision-making.  \nEven if you're not on a task force, we'd still value your input.  Please take this brief survey to note your comparative data priorities.\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RWCNTRZ\n\n",
