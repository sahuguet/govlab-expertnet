  "text": "\n\nWe have a local group of adults who participate in weekly road bike rides about once a week in our city and the surrounding area. There are a couple of volunteer leaders who  send out the annoucements about upcoming rides to the email list. The volunteer leaders have recently approached our Community Center staff asking if they (the volunteer leaders) have any liability for the participants of the rides, and if they should be using liability releases. The rides are free, and the only involvement of the City is to run an annual annoucement in our summer program brochure, and contact information for new participants. \nMy question is: Does anyone have a liabiliy release that can be used by an informal group that is not affiliated with a city, or other entity? Is it recommended that they use one, or better to avoid using one?\nThank you,\nPatty Brescia,\nSenior Programs Manager\nCity of Wilsonville\n\n",
