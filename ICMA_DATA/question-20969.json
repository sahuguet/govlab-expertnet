There is a Resources section that gives examples of different powerpoint presentations, sample documents, publications, films, etc. on the topic. Additionally,  if you click on the \"communities\" link it will list all of cities in the US who have started transition initiatives and gives a link to their individual websites.\nhttp://www.transitionus.org/\nAlso, I have found a document that summarizes Berkeley, California's transition initiative. At the bottom of the document the email addresses for the relevant contacts are listed:\nhttp://bit.ly/gXy9II\nI hope these resources at least begin to help!\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Pamela,\n\nAs I am not a local government official, I do not have any previous experiences with \"transition towns.\" However, I have been able to find a few resources that may prove useful.\n\nThe website for TransitionUS has a multitude of links that provide useful information.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of San Jose, CA is learning more about \u201cTransition Towns.\u201d  This is a movement in response to the idea of \u201cPeak Oil\u201d \u2013 how do communities build in \u201cresilience\u201d in the face of rising oil prices as time goes by?  It will no longer be feasible to get goods from far away so how will local communities meet their needs?  The future could have appreciably less consumption so how do we make that local consumption and utilize renewable energy sources to power it?  The movement began in the UK but is spreading to the US and other countries.  \nThey\u2019d like to know the drivers, how are other local governments dealing with this issue?  What results have you realized?  San Jose believes this topic could be a roadmap to sustainability.\nYour thoughts, opinions, docments etc., are welcome and apprecaited.\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
