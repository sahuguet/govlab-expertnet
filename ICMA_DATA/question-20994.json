The city created a central customer service position to avoid citizens with complaints going through multiple departments to find the right person to help them.

  "text": "\n\nAirdrie is looking for research or information on whether it is better to have callers seeking municipal services call a central point of contact to be either answered or transferred to the correct department, or to publish many individual departmental direct lines, and let customers self-select.  \nOur goal is to limit the number of times that a customer is transferred between departments, the risk being that a misdirected self-selected call may result in further misdirection by a department incorrectly redirecting it, versus a well-trained and informed call centre operator fielding the bulk of the calls and routing them with more certainty.  \nThanks!\n\n",
