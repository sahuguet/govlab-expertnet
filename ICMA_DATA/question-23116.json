I also emailed some ideas directly regarding ad copy that could help. I've run the data on hits, and it looks like you're hitting Matt's recommended rate of ~10:1. You just need more hits! Our ads are also cycled to indeed.com, so it's surprising you're not getting more exposure from that resource.\n\n\nGood advice.
