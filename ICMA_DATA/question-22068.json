  "text": "\n\nHi all,\nI've spent the past few weeks contemplating how we all use the internet as public administrators. This started out as a small survey, but I'm trying to broaden the pool of respondents. If you have a few moments and don't mind sharing your anonymous opinion, click here to take the survey (it's about 10 questions; most are yes/no): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEh5a2xLTzl1a255Q09fM0lhVWNTM1E6MQ#gid=0\nI've written a (relatively) short blog entry about my results so far here: http://www.joshrauch.com/2012/07/31/the-internet-you/\nIf you're interested in the context, that blog entry should help.\nThis is primarily a personal project, as I'm trying to understand how people in our profession understand their professional interactions online. The survey is obviously unscientific and informal.\nThanks for your time and feedback.\nSincerely,\nJosh Rauch\n\n",
