I have  attended social functions and dinners at councilmembers home and had councilmembers at our home for a dinner always with another councilmember a couple of key players in the city or a Department Head and spouses are include always trying to have 8 to 10 people so it was not personal.  If I invited one then I always made certain that at reasonable spacing all of the councilmembers and departments heads were invited to our home so there was no favorites.  It was intended to develop a more collegial working relationship, not develop a personal relationship. \nI also typically at our home had a dinner for Christmas and a BBQ for July 4th with the entire executive team with spouses and children included.  This was to develop a closer team environment and  breakdown bearers and turf issues.  It was also a way of saying you matter to us and to the spouses, we appreciate the sacrifice your family makes to have you spouse working for the city.\nI have ended up becoming friends with some of my past department heads and councilmembers, but never until I have left the city.  Some of them are just wonderful people.\nI also did a number of social functions through the city with all the employees  from all training days for the entire staff, holiday luncheons to just walking around saying hi and thank you.\nI have found socializing of different forms builds stronger bonds and thus a stronger team and loyalty to each other and the ability to resolve conflict better.   That may occur through dinners or partys at our home, or the annual staff retreat or at the weekly staff meetings.  (My staff meetings were always more about relationships and team then just pumping out the next agenda.)  As the CM and if  I am to be successful, I am 100% dependent on these folk to do their jobs and work well together.  If I am doing my job, I don't have the time to keep being a referee.  I want the Police Chief and Public Works Director to be able to work out issues like maintenance of the police vehicles without having to involve me and in a manner they both feel good about.  We have enough people coming at us everyday, we don't need to be coming at each other.  \nIt seems to work well for me, but my department heads and past council members would be a better judge if it worked as well as I thought it did. Never got fired in my 40 years and never had a department head leave because they felt they weren't' being treated right or respected.  They all would say I told way, way too many stories and relayed way, way too many facts that no one ever heard before or ever wanted to hear.\nSo that advice and $3 will get you a coffee at Starbucks.\n\n\nI am friendly but do not allow myself to become personal friends with subordinates or superiors.

Do you fraternize with them outside of work or not?  If so, what boundaries/limits have you set?  What is the reasoning behind your personal policy on fraternization?  I'm not referring to dating or romantic relationships.  Thanks in advance for your input.\n\n",
