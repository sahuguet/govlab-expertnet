The following are some steps we've taken and others we have/are considering right now to limit or divert brush material from the curb.  We are a very large City so some of these may not apply depending on the size of your municipality.\n\nWe have an ordinance that demands brush be source-generated (at the residence it is collected from).\nVolume limits \u2013 We have volume limits on bulky material and we have a recommended volume limit for brush which will likely become mandatory before long.\nHiring a couple inspection officers that could investigate suspicious piles. Are their fresh cuts? Is there more brush than possible from the property it is collected from?\nWe also have a brush drop off and mulching facility.  The rate is very low and residents can pick up free coarse mulch or buy fine mulch for $0.03 a pound.  We're currently constructing another such facility on the opposite side of the City to offer equal access to residents..\nWe offer a dial-a-trailer service where neighborhoods get together on a weekend and we send out a trailer for them to bring brush and other bulky material to (free of charge).\nWe also have four free landfill days in our disposal contracts with area landfills that residents can take advantage of by showing a copy of their utility bill.\nWe are piloting an organics collection program aright now that allows brush as long as it fits in the cart without getting stuck.\n\n\n\nJocilyn,\n\nWe've encountered this to some degree as well.

  "text": "\n\nAs a courtesy, our Public Works Department picks up brush in each resident\u2019s yard. Over the years, the amount of brush the City has been picking up has increased dramatically. We are pretty confident that all of this brush is being generated by individuals not living within the incorporated City limits. I am interested to know if other cities have had this issue and what some potential solutions are for dealing with it. Thanks!\n\n",
