  "text": "\n\nDo any of you require contractors to provide the City with a \"mud and dust bond\" that the City may draw on if the contractor does not pick-up after himself? The example that I have been given is a contractor, by hauling construction materials through town, has left debris on public rights-of-way. If the contractor does not pick it up, the City would pick it up and then bill the work to the contractor. If the contractor failed to pay the invoice, the City would draw off of the bond.\nIf you have something like this, please send/provide the instrument and ordinance.\nThanks in advance.\nDavid Dillner\nCity of Edgerton, KS\n\n",
