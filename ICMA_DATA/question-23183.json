  "text": "\n\nFor cities that offer education or other training reimbursement to employees... \nWhat is your policy in regards to the employee's commitment to the City after the completion of classes or training? In most cases, I am finding a one year commitment by the employee (from the completion date of the courses) or all costs must be paid back to the City (assuming the employee's position was not deleted or some other similar circumstance).\nDoes the commitment requirement fluctuate based on the overall cost? For example, one year of an advanced degree program may cost around  $10,000 whereas 1 year in a specific training program may cost only $3,000. Would both of these programs require the same time commitment? Or, is there a formula that your City uses to determine the commitment?\nIf you want to email your response privately, I can be reached at tcox@fairburn.com \nThanks for your assistance with this!\n\n",
