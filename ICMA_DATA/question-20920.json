  "text": "\n\nWe are going to be conducting interviews soon for a Senior Planner position and was wondering if anyone had some good, non standard interview questions? We have some standard ones, but am looking for some Planner specific, some that might show personality, and strong work ethic. \nI have looked through the documents section and didn't find anything. If you could just respond to this post or email me at myaniglos@albemarle.org, I would appreciate it! Interviews are going to take place next week.\nThanks!\n\n",
