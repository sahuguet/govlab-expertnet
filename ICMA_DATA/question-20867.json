They have set the transparency bar very high. The site has been operational for about 6 months and has been written up in several publications. Surprising to me is that the local citizens have not raised questions and the site is not getting many hits. Besides the Dashboard they have very interesting information on revenues on a related link \"Where Does My Money Go?\" Try this link to get to both the Dashboard and Money: http://www.cityofalbany.net/finance/revenues/\nMy organization will be looking into whether we want to offer something similar.\n\n\nI just came back from a conference where Albany, Oregon presented their Dashboard, an online window into the city's financial, performance measures and other related information.

      "text": "\n\nShelley, Have you considered creating a \"dashboard\" for the city website? Based on a similar model from the State of Michigan, we (City of Troy) are in the process of creating our own dashboard. We are using such indicators as the cost of government, economic strength, quality of life, and public safety. We liked the idea of creating a dashboard because it gives citizens an idea of where we are at without forcing them to read through all types of data. We are still in the production stages and hope to pilot test our dashboard indicators on a focus group in the next few weeks.\n\n\nShelley, Have you considered creating a \"dashboard\" for the city website?
