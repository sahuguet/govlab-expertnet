      "text": "\n\nHi Ronald, \nI have been able to locate some documents that I think will help to answer your question. \nIn Aiken, South Carolina\u2019s 2009 Zoning Ordinance, their sign section seems particularly relevant. Although they do not reference electronic signs and off-premise signs together, it still provides the ordinances for each. In the pdf, the section on signs can be found on pages 90-100, with page 91 about off-site signs and page 100 about electronic signs:\nhttp://bit.ly/fc2QVP\nAlso, the 2008 Zoning Ordinance from Killeen, Texas also makes reference to off-premise electronic signs and goes on to set limits for the intensity of the lights. This information is located on pages 82-84 of the pdf:\nhttp://bit.ly/eSdWhx\nAdditionally, the Village of La Grange, Illinois created a specific sign code. They list general standards for electronic signs on pages 4-5 and off-premise signs on page 9:\nhttp://bit.ly/gOYS9J\nFinally, I was able to find the Houston, Texas Sign Code. This document seemed to be the most useful and clear in terms of answering your question. The relevant pages in the pdf are 67-70.\nhttp://bit.ly/gaVB3H\nEven though some of these documents only give information on off-site signs and electronic signs separately, I hope this at least points you in the right direction.\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Ronald, \n\nI have been able to locate some documents that I think will help to answer your question. \n\nIn Aiken, South Carolina\u2019s 2009 Zoning Ordinance, their sign section seems particularly relevant.
