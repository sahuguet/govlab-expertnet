This methodology should involve at least:\n- A kick off meeting with all key stakeholders (those decision makers who are going to authorize work and priority in those departments involved in the project).\n- A Project Charter signed by all stakeholders. In order to approve the project charter, please always use a benefit/cost chart for all stakeholder, to let them know what the benefits and costs are for all of them because of the project. They all have to sign.\n- Never start planning activities, always deliverables or final product components of the project.

      "text": "\n\nI agree with Jose. The City of Corpus Christi uses a Project Management methodology. We hold an early assistance meeting with a team of staff who have generally received the information a week or so in advance so that they may come to the meeting well prepared. Those staff who have comments come to the meeting. It's a one shot system where if the staff missed something due to lack of preparation, etc on our part, then we dont get a second opportunity to play \"gotcha\". A project manager runs the meeting and gathers pertinent data. If there  is any followup, they do that as well. Their job is to act as a liason with the developer/builder and keep everyone in the communication loop. This prevents major issues from arising. The PM is the staff \"leader\" and as such can call whatever staff from whatever department to the meeting. If there is an issue, they take it up the command chain thru an issue resolution process. We have rarely had to use such tactics as most staff work well together. Our customers love it. I can put you in contact with the consultant who helped us craft the \"process improvements\". He was instrumental in making the shift to a new way of doing business.\n\n\nI agree with Jose. The City of Corpus Christi uses a Project Management methodology.
