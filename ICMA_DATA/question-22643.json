  "text": "\n\nOur city own numeorus small and medium-sized parcels (2-200 acres) and is interested in engaging a registered forester to manage the timber on these properties.  Our primary goal is to develop a long-term program to keep the land and trees healthy in anticipation of future park development at an unknown date, with revenue generation a secondary consideration.  We would like to develop a self-funding program that would allow us to keep idle property cleaned up and perhaps available for more passive uses (walking/biking trails, etc...) while we determine what we will ultimately develop.  Does anyone have any experience in developing a request for proposals/qualifications and the selection process that they might be willing to share?\n\n",
