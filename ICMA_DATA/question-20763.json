We have three documents for setting up the agreements between staff, their supervisor, and the organization: 1) Telecommuting Policies and Procedures, 2) Flexible Work-from-Home Proposal Application, and 3) Team Leader Checklist for Reviewing Work-from-Home Proposals. I've combined all three into one PDF so it can be conveniently attached with this email for your perusal. Good luck. Let me know if you need the Word docs.\n\n\nHi Scott.
