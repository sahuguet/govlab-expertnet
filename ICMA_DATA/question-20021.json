While San Antonio, the largest professionally managed city in the US, has a population of well over 1 million people. \nAs of July 1, 2008 the Census Bureau estimated that there were 304,059,000 individuals residing within the US. Also, according to the National League of Cities there are approximately 19,429 independent municipal governments throughout the United States. From a purely mathematical standpoint, the average population of a US city would be 15,649 residents (304mill / 19,429). However, this number is an average and may be positively skewed due to the relatively few cities with very large populations, i.e. San Antonio. \nIf you were to look at a population distribution of US cities, you would find that a very large number of cities would fall below this 15,000 resident threshold. A median population of US cities would be a much better indicator of the \u201caverage\u201d size of US cities.  The median population for US cities would probably be around 6,000 residents.\n\n\nThis is a very difficult question to answer due to the extremely large variation in municipality populations.
