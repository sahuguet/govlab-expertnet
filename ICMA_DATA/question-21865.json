The switch to CNG involves vehicle conversion costs (right now around $10k for trucks and vehicles, but more for heavy equipment) and the fueling infrastructure cost, this varies considerably, $150k - $500k for a smaller fast fill system.  The key issue being how much fuel you need and how quick.  Our system is a mix between fast fill and slow fill, we have started out with five vehicles.    Let me know what other questions you have.\n\n\nWe are just in the process of implimenting our program.  ARRA funds distributed through the state were utilized.

We need to know how other municipalities financed similar projects for refuse/recycle, police vehicles and public works.  We are looking to fund conversion of vehicles and the infrastructure.
