      "text": "\n\nHi Kimberly,\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement actually partners with the National Research Center's National Citizen Survey, which, among other things, helps you reach out to your citizens and garner useful feedback on your Parks and Recreation programs and facilities.  Conveniently, the National Research Center shares data with CPM, so those jurisdictions that are members of both programs have the added benefit of seeing their NCS data in our CPM Annual Data Report as well, making comparison with other jurisdictions much easier.  If you have any questions about either program, feel free to call me at (202) 962-3652.  Good luck!\n\n\nHi Kimberly,\n\nThe ICMA Center for Performance Measurement actually partners with the National Research Center's National Citizen Survey, which, among other things, helps you reach out to your citizens and garner useful feedback on your Parks and Recreation programs and facilities.
