  "text": "\n\nOur county currently budgets expenses of the Board of Supervisors as a whole rather than by district.  One board member has requested that the board implement by-district budgets which would clearly identify expenses such as salaries, supplies travel, etc.  Are there jurisdictions that budget in this manner and would like to share any best practices? As a related note, I'm interested in Board travel costs and whether these costs are pooled for travel on behalf of the board as a whole, and disbursed with prior board authorization?\n\n",
