The brand was developed quite a few years ago (I'm inclined to say it's over 10 years old), and has been reasonably successful.  Either Preeti Shridhar, their Communications Director, or Alex Pietsch, their Economic Development Administrator, should be able to provide you with a wealth of information.\nGood luck!\n\n\nWe haven't gone through a community branding effort, though city staff and convention center staff are working on a visitor marketing campaign right now.\n\nI'd recommend taking a look at the City of Renton, WA -- they created a community brand through their community marketing campaign, which is funded through hotel/motel tax dollars.

  "text": "\n\nOne of the strategies in our recently developed strategic plan is to develop an over-arching brand for the community.  I'm curious if anyone has recently gone through a thorough community branding process.  Did you use a consultant or did you utilize staff personnel?  How long did the process take?  Were your efforts successful?  Would you recommend a thorough branding process or would you simply roll out a fancy new logo and slogan?\nAlso, I'm looking for RFP's for community branding/marketing.  Any help would be appreciated.  Feel free to send emails/attachments to helmsa@ci.hamilton.oh.us \nThanks.\n\n",
