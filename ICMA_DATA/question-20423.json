  "text": "\n\nA few citizens have requested fitness stations in our main park.  Fitness stations or ParCourse style clusters have been around for a long time, with varied success.   \nTo validate the expense of this amenity in our park, we need to determine the relative popularity of these items in todays world.\nI am looking for communities that have placed fitness stations in parks:    When they were installed.   Recommendations for the product.    Problems of installation or maintenance.   Popularity of this amenity in parks.   Perhaps also the average of the regular user.\nMany thanks,\nPeggy Watters\nCommunity Services Director\nCity of Wisonvile, Oregon\n\n",
