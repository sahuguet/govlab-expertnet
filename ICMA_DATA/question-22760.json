Much of this information can be found in municipal budget books which are typically posted online, and from U.S. census data.  We have incorporated benchmarking into an ongoing review of operations that started with the budget process but continues as we determine our key services and how to best deliver them.  Careful benchmarking allows us to determine if reallocation of resources is called for in order to meet our goals.\n\n\nWhen looking for a good general comparison group of other municipalities we consider population, service levels, FTEs, physical land area (sq mi), budget, centerline street miles, etc.  We also consider geographic location (a city adjacent to another large city may be sharing services) and structure of government (which may impact how services are provided).

Some folks benchmark as a general strategy and benchmark regularly and as a matter of checking their processes against best in class organizations. The American Productivity and Quality Center in Houston has long specialized in benchmarking (http://www.apqc.org/benchmarking) and is a great source for help and information. \nRemember, comparing operating statistics is only the first step -- when someone's numbers are different than yours, you need to understand the \"why\" of that difference. Maybe your process can and should be improved. Maybe there are characteristics of your process that determine a difference and you have chosen that outcome for reasons that relate to your community's choice-making. Don't be restricted in your benchmarking efforts by looking only at government entities -- look at the process no matter in what kind of organization it takes place. Most things you do have some kind of private sector comparable to them.\n\n\n\"Benchmarking is the process of measuring an organization's internal processes then identifying, understanding, and adapting outstanding practices from other organizations considered to be best-in-class.\"\n\nPeople generally consider benchmarking when they are not satisfied with the outcomes of a business process.

      "text": "\n\nHi Leslie.....sorry for the late comment/posting.  You need to think of benchmarking as having two definitions: 1) performance benchmarking and 2) best practices benchmarking (as practiced by the private sector).  Performance benchmarking is identifying, by using quantitative and qualitative performance data (from a good \nsource like ICMA's CPM database or the FL Benchmarking Consortium) who the superior performers are (for a given service) and how your service's performance stacks up against the better performers.  If you look good, stop.  Do you need to be the best?  Work on a service area that is clearly not the best and clearly a concern of customers/stakeholders (high dissatisfaction).\nOnce you have a deficiently performing service area and you know it is by looking at the data for superior performers, then you start best practices benchmarking.......and that is all about uncovering \"why\" their performance is superior and \"why\" yours is not and how you can borrow some of their magic, bring it home and fix your performance.  As a good rule of thumb, the root reasons behind service performance boil down to four main areas that you will need to investigate with rigor: 1) the process itself and especially the number, duration, cost and value-add of each step; 2) technology deployed; 3) people deployed and especially their skill set; and 4) the operating environment, which is both external and internal.  Externally, what physical environment is the service delivered in and internally, what's it like working in this organization.....is it a theory X shop or theory Y shop?  \nOnce you know these things, you will be able to see opportunities for change and improvement in how you do things in your shop.....and maybe you will see a good phased in approach that is affordable and palatable to your organization. Don't under estimate how much change is resisted, prepare for that.\nAs a final note, the best practices benchmarking process just outlined isn't difficult, but it can be exhausting.  It can take a lot of mental perspiration to complete and you need to be prepared for that as well.\n\n\nHi Leslie.....sorry for the late comment/posting.
