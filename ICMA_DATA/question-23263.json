It is difficult to implement even the best ideas if there is no money to carry it out. You will want to help your elected officials dream big while also giving them the tools to make their dreams a reality. Go for it!\n\n\nHello Alexa,\nMost everything comes down to money so unless you are fortunate enough to be able run a city relying solely on volunteers, get as well informed as possible about municipal and economic development finance.

  "text": "\n\nHello everyone,\nI am a 21 year old student starting the MPA program in a few weeks and I'm quite excited! As part of the program, I can select a 12-15 credit specialty however, I'm having difficulties deciding what I should pursue. I would love a career in city management and I think I would pick courses that would be ideal for city management or even leadership courses, the problem is that I will be in a program at a smaller institution and the public administration courses are quite limited so I need to be somewhat creative!\nI hope that you all can provide some guidance for me as to what public sector professionals deem important/useful courses I should select in my master's program.\n\n",
