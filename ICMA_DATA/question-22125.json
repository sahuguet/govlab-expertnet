We looked into sirens but they are expensive up front and have limited utility.  We ultimately decided to go with the CodeRED notification system, which allows us to provide severe weather and other types of public safety emergency alerts, as well as general, non-emergency messages about city events, programs, etc.  We are launching the system later this month.  We have been impressed with the level of sophistication the system offers and we anticipate it will cost us about $10k/year.\n\n\nWe had that same debate earlier this spring here in Suwanee, GA after a tornado came through our city.

I think they still have a role in providing warning, but I too believe with GPS technology in mobile devices that there may be better methods of notifying people more efficiently.

      "text": "\n\nAs an Emergency Manager, I encourage jurisdictions to use multiple methods to disseminate warnings and emergency public information.  Do not put all your eggs in one basket and rely solely on one method.  You must have redundancy in your warning methods, low tech to high tech, as systems can become inoperative or fail for a variety of reasons (power outages, no internet connectivity, storm damage, cyber attack, etc).  Depending on a person\u2019s age, gender, culture, experience, education, disability, and many more factors, they will get their information from different sources and therefore you have to have multiple methods for a diverse population.  Also, over the last several years there have been instances across the country where some of the newer technologies or methods failed to transmit or disseminate warnings.\nThe City of OKC has 182 Outdoor Warning Sirens, one of the largest in the country.  Outdoor Warning Systems (OWS) are but one method to warn the public.  OWS is intended to warn people who are outdoors not indoors.  If you are indoors, then All-Hazard Alert Weather Radios would be a good method to receive the warnings.  \nMass notification systems such as CodeRed, IRIS, and many more can get voice and text messages to a variety of electronic devices and in a format accessible to people with disabilities.  I have found challenges using a mass notification system to provide warnings for no notice events such as tornadoes in a city of our size and population.  Mass notification systems have limitations and I have not found a system that can warn enough people fast enough to meet our needs.  You cannot bet the speed at which OWS transmits a warning.  However, if I needed to warn a smaller segment of our city/population of a location specific hazard, then a mass notification system may be appropriate.  The estimated costs we received from vendors for these systems for a city of our size made them inefficient to be used for only warnings, so consider using them for other purposes such as water, waste water, and sold waste service interruption notifications.  \nThe recent implementation of the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) enables people to receive alerts/warnings on their CMAS/WEA enabled cell phones from participating cell phone providers.  To learn more, go to http://www.fema.gov/commercial-mobile-alert-system .\nDo not overlook social media such as Twitter and Facebook to send out warnings and emergency public information.\nAttached is the Central Oklahoma Regional Outdoor Warning System Guidelines released in February 2011.  We primarily use our OWS for tornado warnings.  In fact, in our area, people expect to hear the sirens at the same time they receive the warning by another method.\nFranklin N.

I am trying to get a sense of whether they still have a use given that they are outdoor warning devices, there are many more resources for warning people today, and the fact people tend to use sirens as notification to go outside and look for storms.\n\n",
