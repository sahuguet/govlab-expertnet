Without legal counsel, I would venture to guess there would be issues with a policy that disqualifies one from employment for being a smoker (especially regulating what a person can do legally while off the job).  There are certainly good examples of regulating smoking in the workplace that make good, common sense.  Wellness programs are also available in many places so that employees who want to quit can get help.  I believe that is as much as you can do.\n\n\nHi Brian.
