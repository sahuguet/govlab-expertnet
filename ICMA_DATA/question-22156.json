  "text": "\n\nThe City of Walnut Creek, California is pursuing an assessment of our arts and recreation programs, with the goal of increasing cost recovery. We are interested in defining our direct and indirect costs, identifying current revenues and cost recovery results, exploring alternate policies to achieve different cost recovery targets, and establishing a pricing policy consistent with these goals. Here\u2019s my question: we are considering the use of a consultant for this project and wonder, do you have any RFP or RFQ documents that that you have issued for similar projects?  If so, I would be happy to receive or discuss them with you, along with your successes/learnings that came as a result of the project.  Thanks very much!\n\n",
