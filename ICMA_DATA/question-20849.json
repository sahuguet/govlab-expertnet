The agreement was based in part on the college's public service improvements. I'd encourage you to check out their award nomination document at the link below, and to try to contact the city of Clayton for more information. \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/302406/Nomination_for_Community_Partnership_Award\n\n\nHi Eric, \nOne of the nominees for last year's ICMA's Community Partnership Award was a Missouri city that successfully negotiated a PILOT agreement with a local college.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Oberlin is home to many churches, schools, and local, state and federal facilities that results in approximately half the property in the community being exempt from property taxes.  Our largest tax-exempt property owner is a private college.  Our City Council is interested in negotiating a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with the college to support general fund operations (police, fire, streets, code enforcement, etc.).\nCould anyone share examples of PILOT agreements that have been agreed to in your communities please?  (Agreements with colleges or universities would be most helpful, but examples of PILOTS with other non-profits would be helpful as well.)  In addition, if there are any studies or other research that can be shared regarding the benefits vs. impacts of colleges/universities that might have bearing on this subject, we would appreciate those as well.\nThanks!\nEric\n\n",
