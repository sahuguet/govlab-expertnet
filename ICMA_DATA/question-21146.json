  "text": "\n\nHi all-The City of Tracy is interested in retrofitting street lights within the next year with cost and energy efficiency as the main objectives.  Does anyone have a cost-benefit analysis for retorfitting residential/outdoor street lights with LED vs induction?  The specific LED wattage we are researching is 52 vs induction wattage of 75.  The overall goal is to present City Council with an overview of total energy savings, operational savings over 5, 10, 15 years and estimated project costs.  The city is in current discussion with Siemens and Pacific Gas & Electric.  We are looking for an objective analysis from another municpality rather than the companies with a vested interested.Any and all help is appreciated.\n\n",
