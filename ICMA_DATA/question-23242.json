The legal requirement is a cost of service method  \nAnother key area is that of the relationship between the general fund and an enterprise fund in terms of inter-fund transfer activity.   \nMy finance director and I recently put together a basic power point explaining the difference for new City Council members.   \nPlease select \"City Council Presentation - General & Enterprise\"  \nhttp://ci.falfurrias.tx.us/index.php/city-government/document-center\n\n\nMark,  \n\nWhat Roderick shared is correct.

      "text": "\n\nMark, both Roderick and Noel are right on target.  I would add in the case of legal and policy framework for use of enterprise funds that there is nothing wrong holding enterprise fund managers to the same standards as anyone else especially in pressing for streamlining services to lower costs for same service delivery.  Enterprise funds should not be immune to such focus just because their revenues can't contribute to the general fund.  It is important to bear in mind that the public pays the fees as well as the local taxes.  Indeed, there can be circumstances where the overall impact on the public can and should be mitigated by reducing enterprise fees if local taxes need to be raised.  Sorry for the weak metaphor but everyone is in the same boat rowing in the same direction just using different oars.\n\n\nMark, both Roderick and Noel are right on target.

I understand the difference between the funds but am getting some feedback from enterprise fund managers that they should not be held to the same budgeting expectations as general fund departments.\nThanks for your help.\n\n",
