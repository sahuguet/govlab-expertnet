  "text": "\n\nAshland, OR is interested in re-vamping their employee performance evaluation process.  They are looking for an easier tool for our supervisors to use in conducting performance evaluations.  For example, a fillable PDF that prompts them through the evaluation.  \nThey would like one evaluation template for general service employees and a separate more in-depth form for evaluating managers.  Please forward your documents or links to:\nTina Gray\ngrayt@ashland.or.us \nThank you!\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 \npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
