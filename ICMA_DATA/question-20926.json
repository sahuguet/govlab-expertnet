Many of our franchise utilities pay only a higher percentage franchise fee in-lieu-of permit fees. We also provide the utilities with an engineering standard of what proper repair entails and inspect each road cut to insure proper repair. We also have instituted a 5 year moritorium plan for cuts into newly paved streets. If trenches absolutely have to be made in moritorium streets we require a 10 foot mill-out and repave beyond the edge of trench.\n\n\nIncreasing fees right now is tough.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Painesville is looking for innovation ordinances to increase revenues by charging a permit fee for street openings and/or the excavation or boring in the right of way, under the roadway, or by cutting a roadway open.  The problem is that utility companies will often come behind a paving project and do not fix the roadway correctly resulting in additional costs over the years.  We are looking for ordinances that have an new way of increasing revenues via permits for these types of activities.  See below.   \n\"No person other than a duly authorized employee or agent of the City shall make, or cause to be made, any excavation, trench or other opening in any portion of any street, alley or other public roadway or thoroughfare, or right-of-way (including sidewalk and tree lawn area), or tunnel under such roadway, thoroughfare, or right-of-way from one side to another or parallel with, within the City without obtaining a permit from the Public Works Director prior to the commencement of any work.\"\nPlease e-mail me the information if you have an ordinance that would assist me.  Thank you for your time in advance.  \nSincerely,\nDouglas L.
