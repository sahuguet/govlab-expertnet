For fuel costs we factor in things such as the estimated MPG, set a price per gallon for fuel, and estimated annual mileage.  For maintenance we look at replacing the tires at the 5 year mark and do some online shopping for the size on the vehicle.  We consider how many qts of oil are needed for a standard oil change and factor those costs into the overall cost.  Looking at all of these different factors played into our most recent DPW pick-up purchase.  We ended up being able to justify a higher up front cost to get an F150 EcoBoost because the total cost of ownership was lower long term based largely on fuel savings.\n\n\nWhat we have done for our small fleet is look at a cost of ownership for 10 years.

You hit the nail on the head that the objective is to try to minimize the total cost of ownership for any purchase (where sometimes it's easy to get lured into other objectives, like maximizing the resale / salvage value, etc).\nIf you contact Cheryl Hilvert at ICMA's Center for Management Strategies (chilvert@icma.org) she can connect us, and I'd like to send you some slides we put together to help organizations do the analysis for exactly this: minimizing the total cost of ownership over the life-cycle of ownership or lease. This same approach can also be helpful in setting up an internal service fund in order to identify an ideal rate structure to charge departments for fleet costs (if you at all wanted to go down that path).\nIn a nutshell, what you'll see in the slides is that we're trying to take into account the following variables:\n- Initial purchase price,\n- Depreciation,\n- Scheduled maintenance,\n- Unscheduled maintenance,\n- Resale / salvage value,\n- Time.\nIt's kind of amazing, but as you plot those variables over time, you can pin-point the time when it makes the most sense to sell the vehicle in order to minimize the total cost of ownership. (What's fun is that you can use the same approach for your own vehicle at home! I even used it to help figure out the lease rate I should get at a dealership, at which point you're down to negotiating with the dealership about their \"profit margin\" which is a much simpler negotiation!).\nAgain, connect with Cheryl, or feel free to email me too (cfabian@pbbcenter.org) and we'll send you the slides so you can create your own charts.\nThanks! Hope this helps.\nChris\n\n\nHi Sarah - this is excellent.
