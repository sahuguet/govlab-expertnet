In case you are unfamiliar with CPM, CPM\u2019s mission is to strive to assist local governments improve the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of public services through the collection, reporting and analysis of performance information.  We encourage the use of performance information in a positive, continuous-learning environment in order to foster organizational cultures that deliver results that matter.  CPM is able to achieve this mission by having participating jurisdictions fill out yearly service area templates (up to 18 service area templates) that are then cleaned and analyzed by staff to help jurisdictions see how they measure up  to similar jurisdictions, whether it be in size, location, climate, etc. The staff does not rank the jurisdictions based on performance, but instead we encourage jurisdictions to use the data given by to them by CPM and benchmark themselves against other communities.  With that being said, one of our service area templates is Parks and Recreation. \nFor Parks and Recreation, one of the key performance indictors is the results from a citizen satisfaction survey. Currently, many of our participating jurisdictions take part in the National Citizen Survey, which is conducted by the National Research Center. The survey measures citizen satisfaction in four different ways. \n\u2022   Citizen Ratings of Recreational Opportunities\n\u2022   Citizen Ratings of the Quality of Recreation Centers or Facilities\n\u2022   Citizen Ratings of the Quality of Recreation Programs or Classes\n\u2022   Citizen Ratings of the Quality of Parks in the Jurisdiction\nMany jurisdictions find the National Citizen Survey or ANY citizen satisfaction survey highly valuable because they are able to measure how satisfied their citizens are with the services the jurisdiction is providing. These types of surveys allow jurisdictions to concentrate on areas where they would like to see citizens more satisfied, as dissatisfaction may indicate areas that need improvement. In addition to citizen satisfaction your jurisdiction would need to conjure up measures that help define \u201cquality.\u201d Some quality measures may be:\n\u2022   Number of playgrounds available in a park\n\u2022   Number of other facilities, like basketball courts, tennis courts, swimming pools, etc.\n\u2022   Number of hiking and walking paths\n\u2022   The conditions of the park, like the frequency of tree maintenance\nThere is a lot to think about when setting up benchmarking measurements in any service area. I would be more than happy to discuss this with you over the phone or through email if you would like.\n\n\nRachel,\nI am currently an analyst for Center for Performance Measurement (CPM) here at ICMA.

  "text": "\n\nOur city is preparing to roll out performance measures for 2012.  We are hoping to gain a better understanding of the quality and efficiency of our services as well as have more data driven discussions with both coucil memebers and citizens.  Eventually we would like to benchmark ourselves with other communities.  So far the hardest part seems to be developing those key performance indicators that actually determines what you measure.  Has anyone else developed performance measures for their Parks and Recreation Departments or Customer Service Departments?  Were certain measures more helpful/reliable than others?  Any response is helpful as we embark on this journey.  Thanks!\n\n",
