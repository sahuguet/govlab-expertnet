      "text": "\n\nThe best example I have found of utilizing firefighters significant down time is in the City of Albany, New York which Tom described. I have attached a PM Article I co-authored about their work as well as the activities of the White Plains, NY public safety department. \nThere the building department was merged into the fire department so that all structural issues are addressed by one agency. The firefighters are certified as code enforcement officers and conduct daily inspections of properties as companies, breaking off from inspections to respond to emergencies as needed. The issue, of course, is putting the significant down time that firefighters have to meaningful use. In our studies of fire departments, large and small, over many years, we have consistently found that fire departments are busy responding to emergencies only about 10% of the time they are on duty. While they certainly do other things such as training and maintenance, there still is considerable non-committed time during the day hours. And many departments operate under collective bargaining agreements that prevent firefighters from performing any proactive, non-emergency response work from late afternoons to early the next morning as well as holidays and weekends. Typically that constitutes about 75% of the time they are on duty. \nSo any work that can be shifted to the fire department takes advantage of this large amount of expensive, nonproductive time. Fire departments have tried numerous ways to utilize that time such as snow plowing and crossing guards. One department we studied used firefighters to run the city print shop which was housed in a fire station. Generally these attempts at increased productivity are met with resistance. The concept of merging structure safety responsibilities and fire suppression activities makes sense from several perspectives and, at least in Albany, received union support, albeit with a pay stipend. As the fire union president told me, \u201cwe like the concept since when we have to do an interior attack the chances are good that we\u2019ve already been inside the building on an inspection.\u201d \nOf course the ultimate effort to use non-productive time in the fire service is the police / fire merger or public safety concept which can also include building inspections.\n\n\nThe best example I have found of utilizing firefighters significant down time is in the City of Albany, New York which Tom described.
