I am interested in what structure you have found successful, mission statements and creative collaboration in setting up such a group.  Details of your program (who sits on the committee or working group, frequency of meetings, what challenges they approach, who among the neighborhood and business groups are involved, etc.).  Email:  jerenewatson@flagstaffaz.gov; 928-213-2073.  Thank you!\n\n",
