  "text": "\n\nWe're looking into revising our vehicle allowance policy. We have some department heads that view the vehicle allowance as a perquisite, while others view it as a reimbursement for all the on-the-job traveling they do. This policy affects the city manager, all department heads, and a handful of division supervisors depending on their responsibilities. The vehicle allowance policy outlines four options--a take-home vehicle for a few, and then three different monthly allowance amounts for the rest.\nI've looked all through the Knowledge Network and I'm unable to find much by way of comparison between cities. All I've been able to find so far are allowances for city managers. What does your city do in this regard?\n\n",
