We lost population in the last census and our GF has been declining steadily over the last five years.  We felt that with PA 4 of 2011 as well as the EVIP situation the SBC would reject any efforts by any jurisdiction to go from a GLV to a HRC.  We are a full service GLV but we couldn't justify spending the necessary funds to complete a study that really needed to be spearheaded by a non-political/council group.  We may revisit this in the future if we survive the wake and shake up going on in Michigan over the next decade.\n\n\nHi Timothy,\n\nWe looked into it going from a GLV to a HRC but determined with all that's going on at the state level and the SBC now would not be a good time in which to pursue this avenue.

  "text": "\n\nWe have recently formed a citizen's committee to explore a change from a General Law Village into an incorporated Home Rule City. I was hoping to hear of experiences other communities have had with city incorporation. Particularly I am curious to hear what experiences were had with opposition to this change. Also, if city incorporation failed, why did it fail? I would appreciate any insight on this matter.\n\n",
