This is a simplified activity-based costing exercise of sorts. Alternatively, you can research the staffing levels of the municipality that is similar in size/characteristics of your projected growth.\n\n\nJeffrey, you can forecast your resources by first creating a model that determines the FTE requirement/resource needed to produce each unit of service (based on your current level) and then have the model drive your future requirement based on the increase in the number of service units.

Most cities provide an employees per resident statistic in their budget books and I have used that in the past after developing a good comparison group.\n\n\nI would add to Yana's comments above that if you research the staffing levels of other municipalities take care to consider demographics, geographic proximity to other major population centers (for shared services), land area (sq. mi.), centerline miles of streets, services provided, budget size and other key parameters when benchmarking.

  "text": "\n\nI work for a city that is on the cusp of rapid growth (both residential and commercial).  Management knows that we will need to increase our staff size in order to continue to provide the same level of service, but we do not know how to forecast those future needs in a non-arbitrary fashion (i.e. with data).  We have estimates as to future populations via our comprehensive plan and research collected by the council of governments.\nMy question is whether or not there are models or \"rules of thumb\" that can be utilized to help determine future staffing needs in response to population growth?\nThanks in advance for feedback!\n\n",
