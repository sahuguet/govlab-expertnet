He steps through each item and asks the appropriate Program Director any questions he might have about the item.  Following that, we review the list of major Agenda presentations for the next six weeks of Council and Council Committee meetings to ensure participants are on schedule.  Following this, we review the next month or two of key community activities from the Community Calendar that our PIO keeps.  Then, we open the floor to any announcements from the Directors such as significant Program/Department events, employee recognition, etc.  This approach has greatly enhanced the level of staff preparedness for Council events and keeps everyone informed about what  other Programs are doing.\n\n\nWe hold a weekly Council Agenda Review/Directors Meeting every Tuesday morning where the City Manager reviews the agenda items for the Thursday morning City Council Study Session.

For example, after a few minutes of \"official business\" the host department would provide a full presentation of issues, updates, goals, objectives, special projects, staff updates, etc. for their department.  The next month another department would do their department update review, etc. etc.    \nWith 11 departments it worked out nicely and we learned a lot about one another and our individual departments \u2013 of course, at first we were sure we knew everything about every department.  I really enjoyed the monthly department sponsored meetings.\n\n\nJon - a city I worked for in CA we used to use the non-council meeting week (3 meetings per month) each month at the Department Head meeting we'd featured a department.

We've always had two staff meetings/month that are very tactical - hearing updates from each department, addressing short-term issues, etc.  After attending some training on High Performance Organizations (Thanks Montgomery, OH!), we've really embraced the idea of spending more effort on leadership development, strategic thinking, etc.  Just this month, we moved forward with changing one of those meetings to a \"Q2 Meeting\" - this is based on 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, if you haven't read it.  Our first several meetings will be more educational - this month's was on encouraging Q2 throughout our staff team.  In other meetings, we're going to talk about our organizational culture, how to keep employees motivated and engaged, etc.  Once we've gone through this initial educational process as a team, we plan to use these meetings as an opportunity for staff from all levels/departments to strategically plan and address important issues.\n\n\nJon - We've been discussing the same issue in Suwanee.
