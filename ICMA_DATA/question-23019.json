I prefer being the conduit with the Council when their inquiries can't be done in the public meeting which is usually best so they all get the same info and act as a body not individually.  On occasion when they have had an appropriate educational meeting with dept heads, I am just kept abreast of the meeting and that works fine when I can't attend.\n\n\nI would wonder why is the Councilmember meeting with staff or dept heads, and whether their intent is educational or to feel inclined to direct staff to do something, which in my Council-Manager city shouldn't occur.
