I'm not aware of any government that has done the rolling approach but it would replicate what those of us who have used bienniel budgeting do in terms of preparing a second year's budget -- just every year as opposed to every other year.

  "text": "\n\nMy jurisdiction is looking into beginning to use a 2-year rolling budget.  Appropriations would occur each year but a second planning year would be shown in the budget document.  I was wondering if there are other jurisdictions that use a rolling budget as opposed to a true biennial budget that might be willing to share the key assumptions or guidelines used to establish the estimates for the second year for both revenues and expenditures.\nThanks\n\n",
