      "text": "\n\nHi Donato:\nI actually have a few examples for you, one of which is a surprisingly well-known park (Central Park in New York).  There is a study from a few years ago about privatization of government services, which you can find here (http://reason.org/files/db38316bd23c0beef9d021a9fd7af1ea.pdf).  In it, there are several case studies about various municipalities which have privatized various portions of their park systems (on pages 31-33).  They all seem to have had successful outcomes.  Other places, like Sacramento, CA, have had difficulties determining if privatization is right for them, even after commissioning a study for their City Council (http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/8337/Residents_continue_campaign_against_budget_cuts_to_parks).  Finally, I have found a company called Recreation Resource Management (http://camprrm.com/), which has been contracted more than a hundred times to run local, state, and federal parks around the nation.\nAs for a sample bid specification, I have inquired with several of those municipalities and groups, but have yet to hear back.  Once I do, I will post an additional response here for you.\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nHi Donato:\n\nI actually have a few examples for you, one of which is a surprisingly well-known park (Central Park in New York).
