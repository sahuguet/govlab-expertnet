  "text": "\n\nHello, \nI am in need of a job description for a power plant operator. I know many cities do not operate their own power plant, let alone one with diesel turbines, but I'm hoping someone out there does or has something similar. We have a need to hire some additional staff for our power plant but lack a job description since the last time a person was hired for the position was nearly two decades ago. I would greatly appreciate any help. \nThanks.\nDaniel Ortiz\nCity Administrator\nCity of Kimball\nPhone:  308.235.3639\nEmail: DOrtiz@kimballne.org\n\n",
