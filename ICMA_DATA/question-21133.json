I know many people will have a variety of answers, so I will share some observations and my opinion with you.\nFirst, I try not to ask the public's satisfaction with any single service alone \u2013 they are almost always happier with it when there is no other comparison. It lacks context for decision making. \nMany people use a community survey to ask about satisfaction and importance, then use a quadrant chart to show how well aligned satisfaction and importance are. I think this is a great practice that gives you part of the answer. \nWording and asking these questions the same way as a large group of comparable cities is also helpful, so you can compare to the average satisfaction and importance for further value (National Citizen Survey is pretty good, as is ETC Institute, but there are many options)\nSomething to know about public safety: Unless they have just been involved in a messy political problem, Fire and Police will nearly always be the top rated services, with Police topping Fire in importance (in most cases) but Fire topping Police in overall satisfaction; almost anyone who has been rescued and transported will be very happy with the service unless they were responsible for the problem or if they experienced permanent damage - and even then, they will usually still rate service positively, just less so. The ratings are usually so high (all over 90%) that they are of marginal value for decisions.\nI will suggest two questions: \na.  Do you want to know if they are \"happy\" or \"satisfied\"?  I suspect \"satisfied is enough in the current economy. If we are a business shouldn\u2019t  we focus on satisfying the need with quality service at an affordable cost?  Happy can cost a lot more!\nb.  Should we be asking \"how satisfied they are\" or \"how well are we meeting their expectation\"? The second question has become more popular recently because it avoids the absolute scale and focuses on if we are doing what we should be!  I have seen a few cities start to use this and if I am surveying next  year it will become part of our question bank.\nI hope this helps,\nTom\n\n\nGreat question!
