  "text": "\n\nIn a recent recruitment, I was confused by one of the screening criteria, \u201cDo not have any break(s) in service - voluntary or involuntary \u2013 in their professional history.\u201d  Managers are fired for a multitude of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with the manager\u2019s competence, e.g., political expediency, unethical behavior by a council member or by the Council as a whole, change in community dynamics, etc.  Is this a common criterion?  If so, what underlies councils\u2019 thinking on the issue? Thanks!\n\n",
