  "text": "\n\nGood morning,\nI'm re-evaluating the amount of cash and checks that my city should keep on hand in the event of a disaster.  (Note: I am not referring budgetary reserves, but actual hard cash/checks kept in case a major disaster knocks out banking and communications networks.)  This was a critical issue for many municipalities after Hurricane Katrina.\nTo that end, I am wondering:\n- How much cash does your city/county keep on hand for emergency management purposes?\n- How many handwritten checks does your city/county keep on hand for emergency management purposes?\n- How did your city determine these amounts (if known)?\nThe answers I have found thus far range from $0 to $250,000. \nI appreciate everyone's help in gathering this useful information.\nThank you,\nPete Ruscitti\nOffice of Emergency Management\nCity of Beverly Hills\n455 N Rexford Dr\nBeverly Hills CA 90210\nruscitti@fastmail.fm | 619-471-5853\npruscitti@beverlyhills.org | 310-285-1040\n\n",
