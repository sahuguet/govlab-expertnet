  "text": "\n\nWe are looking for sample RFP's for a Food & Beverage vendor at our municipal golf course. This could be for a snack bar or a small restaurant. Specifically, we are designing a new clubhouse with an area for a kitchen. The function of the kitchen has not been determined but can be expanded depnding on that scope. Right now it is described as a snack bar with seating for 60 but there is some community interest for a restaurant. We want to see what the interest is from food vendors in operating this space. Thank you.\n\n",
