The staff people at these jurisdictions come from many different departments. Each jurisdiction may be structured separately but the commonality among the staff who work on engagement projects is that they are people who have an interest in understanding and managing the relationship between the city administration and its residents. In many jurisdictions someone from the city manager's office is involved, as well as the PIO, along with representatives from departments likely to want to interact with residents. \nWe have many more clients who are highly competent at public engagement. Contact me if you want references in a specific region.\n\n\nHey Melissa, \nWe collaborate with many client government agencies who are quite skilled at engaging with the public. \n\nFor example:  \nVirginia Beach VA on the East Coast, \nEau Claire WI in the Midwest, \nSalt Lake City UT in the Mountains,  \nWalnut Creek CA on the West Coast, and \nWest Vancouver in Canada. \n\nWhat they all have in common is their coordinated effort at publicizing their engagement activities and the communication back to citizens about the outcomes of the engagement exercises.

But even the smallest organizations can send leaders to engage citizens groups, neighborhoods, and school classes.\nI'm still working on the full report and would love for you to get involved with it! Cindy Mester (Falls Church) and I are presenting the findings at the VLGMA conference in Virginia Beach. Will you be able to join us?\nI'm at mreges@albemarle.org and on linkedin.\n\n\nI recently conducted a survey on this topic and have responses from 69 Virginia localities, with info on their engagement/education practices and how those activities are coordinated.\n\nThe short answer is that it usually comes right from the manager's office, and that bigger localities have better staff resources available for new media and involved activities like leadership academies.

Portland has learned a lot about what works and doesn't work in community involvement. A few years ago, Portland adopted a new expanded strategy to: involve a greater diversity and number of Portlanders in civic life, to build capacity in community leaders and community organizations and help them link together, and to increase the impact of community members on local decision making. The City of Portland Office of Neighborhood Involvement is leading these efforts to involve more people, strengthen community capacity, and to increase the willingness and ability of city staff and leaders to involve the community in a genuine governance partnership. I'd be happy to provide you with more information. Just let me know what would be most useful to you.  Another great resource is the Institute for Local Government in California--see their website at:  http://www.ca-ilg.org/public-engagement.\n\n\nThe City of Portland, Oregon this year is celebrating the 40-year anniversary of Portland's community and neighborhood involvement system.
