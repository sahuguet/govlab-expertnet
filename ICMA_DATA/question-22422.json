  "text": "\n\nHello All!  \nI am looking for other municipalities who have flex-time and comp-time policies for their salaried employees.  Some of our FT salary employees are  under the impression that they have comp hours while others are not--they were hired by different city managers.  We need a policy that specifically states what our comp-time and flex-time policies are in order to clear up this confusion.  In addition, how does this comp-time policy apply to emergency services departments where they are pretty much on call 24-7?  Is there a cap put on the number of comp hours accrued?  How are such hours tracked--and are they approved ahead of time for non-emergency services employees?  I clearly have lots of questions, so any help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks everyone in advance!\n\n",
