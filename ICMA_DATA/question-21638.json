      "text": "\n\nRather than taking on wholesale changes to individual planning and community development departments, ten cities in the Puget Sound region formed an interlocal agency to provide regional, shared service web portals.  In forming the eCityGov Alliance, the founding city managers and city administrators wanted to focus improvement efforts on the customer service aspects of city services.  Instead of making contractors visit multiple permitting web sites, the Alliance launched a one-stop, online permitting portal in 2002.  MyBuildingPermit.com (MBP) currently serves 12 cities and one county.  The site has issued over 60,000 permits to date and recently expanded online permitting to include some permit types that require plan review.  Work is underway to expand the service to include most all development permit types by the end of 2012.  \nMBP is supported by the local master builders association to the point that the association is actively supporting a fee increase to cover the city\u2019s cost of supporting MBP.  In short the master builders are advocating for a single regional online permitting solution over individual solutions.  At the same time the association is fully aware that while a single online permitting portal will provide some level of improved consistency in the process, they know and accept that each jurisdiction will have different fees and unique requirements (particularly for land use).  Of course they would like to see the regulatory bar lowered, but realistically are asking for clarity of requirements, consistency and predictable timelines.  \nAn individual city might have the best, fastest and most predictable permitting process in the nation, but that is of only marginal value to a contractor that has to deal with dozens of different jurisdictions.  In other words variation drives cost and takes more time.  Instead of asking your customers to rate your service (which is probably pretty good), a more appropriate first question might be, \u201chow can we help your business be more successful?\u201d\nOf course collaboration is not only going to take a higher level of effort, but also require executive sponsorship and a formal governance structure commensurate with the scope and scale of the program.
