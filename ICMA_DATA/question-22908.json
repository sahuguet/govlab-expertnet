Our motto is \" we Never close\". most of our workforce would be considered essential but like you except for continuous operations like Sheriff, Hwy, Jail, NursingHOme, EMS DMV  and DSS we let employees use their discretion and leave credits if they are uncomfortable trying to drive to work. our 500 sq miles provides for some variable conditions within the county and we have 14 facilities including a GA airport to keep operational.The NYS Thruway bisects our County and we have 3 interchanges off the thruway so that engenders more issues with Truck traffic and how to get them safely off the THruway and onto our local reststops till the weather subsides.  In the past selective office closings has been more of a pain and problem with unions than adhering to the above Motto. At least it's not a hurricane or tornado zone , both of which I've lived and worked in in my local government career.\n\n\nMark - we are literally dealing with this issue today with the heavy snow , high winds and low temps in WNY near buffalo and 2 great lakes- Erie and Ontario.

  "text": "\n\nOur County has a standing policy not to close.  The issue often comes up in the winter time as heavy snow and cold creates challenges for employees to get to work.  With many of our employees considered essential including Highway, Sheriff, Court, Health, Human Services, etc the topic is even more difficult.   Our general policy is that employees should make their own decisions, and take a leave day if necessary.  I was curious what your policy is?  And how you treat the different employee groups.\nThank you.\n\n",
