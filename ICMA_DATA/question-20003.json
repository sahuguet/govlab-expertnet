The Code, written by members NOT LAWYERS, connects the mission to the job.  Its the foundation that inspires and guides their conduct every day in a countless number of decisions they make.  As educated committed professionals we can't subscribe to something that doesn't fit on the back of a card? I don't believe it but if you want to get it to the elevator speech here goes:  \"We commit to deliver fair, equitable and efficient services in a transparent way to the community we serve. We will respect and promote our Democracy and stay out of politics. We will seek no favor. We act with integrity in our personal and professional conduct to merit the trust of those we serve. We will treat out employees, elected officials and residents with respect. We are building communities that will outlast us.\"  Is that too hard to remember?\n\n\nToo bad that Bob Sloan, who is generally thoughtful about this issue, didn't do a bit more research before making his statement.

It seems to me that the goal is good governance and that is characterized by honesty, accountability, transparency, and inclusion. I have found myself working these last few years in environemnts characterized by an absence of ethics. It corrodes institutions, corrupts bureaucracies, deters investment, and undermines the legitimacy of government.

Most people can't ...live by the ICMA code because they simply can't remember any of it.\" \nAs a member, do you live by the ICMA Code of Ethics? Do you find the 12 Tenets difficult to follow or remember (or if you\u2019re not-in-service to local government, only Tenets 1 and 3)? Or are they inherent in the values of professional and good governance?\nFor the whole article:\nhttp://www.governing.com/columns/mgmt-insights/A-Wallet-Sized-Code-of.html\n\n",
