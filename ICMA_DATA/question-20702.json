      "text": "\n\nAs the former  City Manager of Beverly Hills, we had 400,000 square feet of commercial office and retail space we leased out at full commercial value and over 5,000 public parking spaces.  The commercial operation was under the Administrative Services Department (which included Finance) overseen by an experienced commercial property manager hired as an employee of the city.  There were maintenance problems, but we elected to not create two building maintenance operations.  (You will lose good tenets if you don't keep the property up to standard.) Instead, we had Public Works enter into a formal contract with Property Management with the same terms and conditions as if contracted with a private party.  The contract was reviewed monthly for compliance with response times and costs.  there were built in financial penalties to the Public Works Department budget if PWD did not meet the terms of the contract.  The system worked well.  The turn around times for PDW could be forgiven by the City Manager if an emergency or urgent need arose such as flooding or visiting dignitaries requiring road closures.\nThis left us the ability to put a lot of resources on a property if an major problems arose and to divert internal resources for city emergencies increasing the over response capacity for both operations and keeping a better economy of scale within the maintenance operation.\n\n\nAs the former  City Manager of Beverly Hills, we had 400,000 square feet of commercial office and retail space we leased out at full commercial value and over 5,000 public parking spaces.

After a year or so we moved job to DPW and placed person under the Executive AA who both tracks all work requested and sets up daily work schedule for employee.  We have sent this Exec AA to several training programs to learn about building maintenace so we can develop  preventative and capital maintenance budgets.  With this training our  Exec AA is now able to act as the buidling maintenance supervisor.     She reports to the Director of DPW who reports to me.
