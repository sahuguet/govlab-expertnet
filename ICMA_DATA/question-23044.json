  "text": "\n\nThe City of Mason is looking to get some feedback from other local municipalities on how they handle partnerships with religious organizations in the community. We have an organization that would like to run a bible study out of our community center but we are hesitant because we do not want to upset residents who may be of different religions, and also this may open the door to an influx of organizations contacting us to offer the same services inside our community center. Has any other local municipalities dealt with this issue and if so we are eager to learn how you have handled this topic.\n\n",
