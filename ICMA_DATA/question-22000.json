They are one of the top applicants and if not currently employed by a neighboring community would get an interniew without question.  I do not believe they are member of ICMA and subject to a minimum two year committment to a community.  I plan to reach out to the applicant and offer mentoring, however, I struggle with the decision to interview.  \nFirst is their any ethical issue with either interviewing an applicant working in a neighboring community and/or the applicant's tenure in that community?  \nSecond, is their an ethical guide to interview and/or hire the best applicants for the position?\n\n",
