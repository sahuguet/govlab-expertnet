Some of the measures we selected include: Total number of Businesses; New jobs created due to business relocations, expansions, and redevelopment; Vacant Space Leased per Economic Development Efforts (in Square Feet); Percentage of Developed Property w/in our Commerce Park; Percentage of  Leased (not vacant) Property w/in our Commerce Park.  We are also incorporating a measure that looks at incentive ROI, though this is a long term measure for which we are only just beginning to collect data.  We will be collecting: Total ($) Amount of Incentives; Pre-Development Revenue; Developed Property Revenue; and Total Jobs Created (incentive recipients).  If you have any questions please don't hesistate to contact me at bernadette.hughes@tamarac.org.  Good luck!\n\n\nThe City of Tamarac is currently developing an economic development scorecard.

The single, most important underlying factor at the outset is answering the question \"what are the boundaries for the measurements?\".  For instance, if a community suffers an unemployment rate above the national average then the foremost priority could be job creation for the unemployed residents but the community accepts that successful economic development to create those jobs does not have to be within the municipal boundaries but, rather, within the commutable area of the unemployed.  So, if the community's economic development efforts succeed in contributing to the location of a manufacturer in the next city and of the 300 jobs created, 150 are filled by their unemployed then it is a success as along as it was agreed at the outset that the measure was not restricted to city limits.  I hope this helps as a starting point.\n\n\nWithin the economic development profession, this is a really hotly debated subject with a wide variation of answers and ideas.
