  "text": "\n\nYou weren't ready to whittle while rocking back and forth on the porch during your retirement from the local government management profession; these golden years weren't going to be filled with reruns of Blanche, Sophia, and Rose and eating dinner at 3:00p. You decided to delve into a new and exciting encore career.\nMaybe you drop some beats and turn up the bass as you scratch records or don a red nose as you dress up like a clown during community fairs. Perhaps you invoked the spirit of The Captain and Tennille and your love of the open seas has kept you together with directing cruise ships.\nThe Afterlife: Our Encore Performance session at this year's ICMA Annual Conference seeks two additional speakers who have interesting encore careers that differ from the standard teaching, consulting, or writing that many retired professionals have undertaken.\nIf you're attending the Conference in Charlotte and would like to share your not-so-traditional encore career, please let me know directly (jdailey@icma.org; 202-962-3557). The session is scheduled for Monday, September 15 from 2:30p - 3:40p. Thank you in advance.\n\n",
