  "text": "\n\nI am heading a project that includes getting employers to take on work study/work epxperience customers for 3-6 months and train them in various positions (without pay).  After the said term is up and the custoer has successfully completed the training we want the employer to agree to hire them permanently benefits and all.  Can you design a letter from me Career Development  to the Employer asking them to participate in this program.  \nI also need ideas/leetter as to how to present the program to the customer without pay.  Most customer need pay and desire pay.  However, if they do well the bottom line is they will become gainfully employed.  If not they still have hands on employment experience they have aquired.\n\n",
