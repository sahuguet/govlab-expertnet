  "text": "\n\nCollegues,\nI am currently interested in finding \"non-traditional\" models in providing the typical human resources functions.  This could encompass anything from a minor public/private partnership to privatizing divisions within the HR Department (like workforce development or benefits administration), to a total privatization effort.  Our HR Department services 2500 employees with 29 HR professionals.  Any success stories worth sharing would be appreciated.  Thanks\nTerry Welker - Executive Director of Human Resources - Scottsdale, AZ.\n\n",
