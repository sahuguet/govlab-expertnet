This is a Xerox company that will charge more per copy than the .002 cents per black and white copy average in the suite. If color copies are requested the cost increases quickly, so we ask hard questions about why color copies are necessary for jobs with color scopes.  Having a quality in house color copy solutions is critical for quick turn around and cost effectiveness but making sure that you have the right mix for quality copies is something that everyone needs to be aware is a reality.\" \nHope that gives you a little more detail.\n\n\nICMA's facilities manager Kenneth Belton has reviewed your question and emailed me the following statement regarding COS: \n\n\"What we have done here at ICMA is gone with a dual system of having small jobs done in house and larger more complicated jobs done professionally by the copier center in the building.
