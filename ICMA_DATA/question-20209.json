Though this has not passed yet, the article has some good ideas for those local governments which are interested in this possibility: http://icma.org/en/Article/100448/The_Latest_Fiscal_Buzz_Medical_Marijuana\n-Second, there is a recent article from the Los Angeles Times, regarding not only the taxation of the dispensaries by the local government, but also taxes on cultivation sites (by the square foot, in the case of the Long Beach area).  Check out the article here:\nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/100449/Long_Beach_City_Council_votes_to_pursue_medical_marijuana_tax\n-Third, there is an older article about the process of taxing medical marijuana in Colorado, but it brings up several interesting points about marijuana cultivation facilities and dispensaries being happy to pay taxes, as a mode of becoming more legitimized in the eyes of skeptics.  The article is here:\nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/100450/Colorado_Could_Become_First_State_to_Regulate__Tax_Medical_Marijuana\n-Finally, the city of Redding CA is going to try and make both jumps at once (both legalizing the medicinal use of marijuana as well as taxing it locally), coming up for voting this November.  Although this is a very recent development, perhaps Redding can offer advice on this process as they move forwards: \nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/100451/Redding_City_Council_to_consider_marijuana_tax\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Pamela:\n\nHaving looked into this issue, it seems to be on the minds of many local governments at the present time, so there are several starting points I can offer them.\n\n-First of all, the city of Berkley CA just put out a vote to its citizens regarding the possibility of a 2.5% tax on the marijuana outlets in the city.
