  "text": "\n\nOver the past decade or so the City has used the sworn officers per thousand of population as our staffing standard.  We are finding this staffing ratio to not be realistic with the current economic conditions local governments are facing.  I am doing some research on other police staffing standards and would be interested to hear other standards used by cities.\nThanks,\nMatt McQuillen\n\n",
