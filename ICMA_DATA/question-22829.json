The only resources I was able to find on this topic was a chapter on Fleet Management from a report by the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement. This document contains extensive information on the cost of maintenance (http://cpm.icma.org/Data/2003/Pdf/FY%2003%20Fleet%20Management%20Chapter.pdf). In addition to this report I found the \"Transit Bus Life Cycle Cost and Year 2007 Emissions Estimation\" by the U.S. Department of Transportation (http://www.proterra.com/images/WVU_FinalReport.pdf). I hope you find these resources useful and that any other members who have information on this topic chime in and submit their information to the Knowledge Network. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Gregory, \n\nUnfortunately we do not many a lot of information on this topic on the Knowledge Network right now.
