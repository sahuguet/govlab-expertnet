Most aspects of human resources administration, law and institutions, technical skills such as analysis of policy options, performance measurement, intergovernmental relations, and use of information systems seem to be well-covered. Budgeting is, too, except it is studied mostly from the perspective of the decision-making (policy) process used to arrive at a budget and rarely from the perspective of using the budget in a way that will produce desired behaviors by operating staff (i.e., as a management tool). \nLess well-covered are theories that would support competencies in listening, persuasion, informal communication, understanding the psychological needs of others, project management, empowerment of staff and community members, collaboration, and facilitating participatory decision making.\"  \nFor more info, see JPAE, summer 2010, p. 337 - http://naspaa.org/JPAEMessenger/Article/VOL16-3/16no3_final.pdf\nWill also attach a summary of 12 major categories and 118 individual competencies that seem important for senior local government managers.\n\n\nExcerpt from my dissertation: \"What the research results do show, however, is that some city management competencies receive a great deal of attention in the public administration academic field, and others are virtually ignored.
