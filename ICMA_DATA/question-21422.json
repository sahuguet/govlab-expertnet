  "text": "\n\nWe currently do not have a policy for change in employment status as it relates to service year credit. This would impact vacation accumulation. Does anybody have a policy they could share?  I am looking for sample policies that allow someone to receive service year credit when moving from one position to another (either moving from one department to another or moving from part-time to full-time). Also, does anybody have a policy that gives service year credit to anybody who leaves the organization and comes back after a period of time? Thank you.\n\n",
