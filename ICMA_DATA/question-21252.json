I'm not aware of any sources that analyze the cost of local government service provision by demographic characteristics of residents. The good news is that there are a number of sources, including the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement (CPM), which have information regarding per capita costs of particular services and overall services. More good news is that your local government is a CPM participant. Thus, you may access CPM's private website, which includes all of this data.  \nJust point your browser to icma.org/cpm and follow the prompts to gain access to the private area. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the site, help is available at cpmmail@icma.org.  \nOnce on the site, choose Data & Templates from the menu across the top and then choose the year and service area for the information you'd like to browse. For organization-wide information (including general fund expenditures which can be used to run the per capita calculation), please choose the General Government & Demographics category. Other service area titles are fairly straightforward. \nFor jurisdictions not participating in CPM, selections from the program data are available in our annual report in the ICMA Bookstore (http://bookstore.icma.org/Comparative_Performance_Measur_P2125C175.cfm). \nI hope this is helpful. Wishing well in your research!\n\n\nHi Tessa-I'm sorry about the delay in getting  a response to your question.
