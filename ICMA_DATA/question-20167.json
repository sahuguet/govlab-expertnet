In the instance of a holiday within a work week, we let the employees work 32 and receive 8 hour holiday pay.  We only have 10 holidays per year, and considering the additional sacrifices the employees have made for the organization, we felt this was a fair resolution.\nSecond, with our PW employees working four \"9s\" to reach their 36 in the summer, what do you do when an employee has a holiday (or other PTO) which is traditionally 8 hours and now is working a 9/10 hour days?  In this instance, we have determined that the employee will only receive the 8 hours for the holiday and they can make up the additional hour by using comp time or working an hour during the remainder of the week.\nHope this helps.\n\n\nAllison, You raise a good question that rasies an additional issue.  \n\nFirst, to answer your question, we had a similar issue when we went to 36 hour weeks (half-day Fridays).

If we are working Mon thru Thru with Friday off and Friday is a pd holiday, does the employee forfeit a holiday or are they able to have another day off, similar to when a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday?  We need clarification on this.  Can anyone help?\n\n",
