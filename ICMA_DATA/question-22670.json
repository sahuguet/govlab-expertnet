  "text": "\n\nDear ICMA,\nMy name is Sven Stafford and I am the director of development at the American University of Central Asia in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic. This semester I am teaching a course on public administration, and would like to have my class do semester-long research projects on traffic issues in Bishkek.\nI am looking for someone who would be willing to coach me as I help the students in their research. This would involve helping to create realistic and specific research questions, advising on methodology, and helping us troubleshoot during the semester.\nIf you are interested, please respond and we can set up a time to Skype, and I can fill in more of the details.\nSincerely,\nSven\n\n",
