Typically, we hire a structural engineer to evaluate and report on the structure under the terms of our dangerous building ordinance.  Based upon that report, we notify the owner and demand that they either make the structure safe or demolish the structure.  They have a limited time to appeal the engineer's determination to a Building Review Board before the city can compel demolition.\n\n\nBeing a smaller city, we do not have any full-time staff that are qualified to make such determinations.

If there appeared to be structural issues, we required them to hire a structural engineer to send us a letter indicating the condition according to his assessment and if necessary, his recommendations for repair. If the structure was found to be unsafe, we required them to either repair it in accordance with the recommendations of their engineer or demolish it. If they refused to do either, they would sometimes just hand over the title to the city knowing we would pay to tear it down. If they refused to tear it down or repair it and did not want to give it to the city, we pursued legal action requiring demolition. We experienced people choosing all options: repair, demo, and transfer of title to the city.\n\n\nI attached our city code indicating how this is handled in our city.

Who makes the determination that the structure is unsafe and what is the burden of proof for demolition? Do any cities employ structural engineers in either their development services or code compliance departments to assist in the process?\n\n",
