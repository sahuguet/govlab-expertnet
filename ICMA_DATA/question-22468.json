Florida and its cities can be a good resource for such plans and policies which can offer ideas.  Absent a a CRA setting, in my experience, it is usually specific to a targeted goal rather than a citywide policy and is usually driven by a specific potential industry or private investment.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the approach you are contemplating but from an economic development perspective, it would be very wise to undertake any land aquisitions based on a clearly defined plan with a solid marketing goal to attract new investment or you do risk taking property off the tax rolls and being stuck with them.\n\n\nDepending on the laws of the state and what is allowed, if a state permits a community to create a community redevelopment agency then generally the focus of a community will be on the designated area covered by the CRA and there is usually an overall plan which includes an aquisition policy.

  "text": "\n\nIn Clive we have an older area of the community we have been trying to redevelopment for a number of years.  Some of our elected officials are wanting to pick up the pace of redevelopment by considering some land acquisitions in the area.  This discussion brought up a larger topic of having an overall land acquisition policy for the City.  I have some ideas on what we might include in a policy draft but I wanted to see if other cities have tried this overall policy approach or if it is more specific to a certain part of the community?\nI thank you in advance for any information you can provide!\nMatt McQuillen\n\n",
