It is interesting to note that some law enforcement officers say that such strict immigration laws will increase crime. This is because numerous studies find lower crime rates in communities with high immigrant populations.  However, these studies look at legal immigrants, not illegal.  These communities decrease crime because they are stable and the residence have an interest in maintaining law and order. Illegal immigration other hand is a different story.  Such activity brings with it human trafficking, drugs and arms smuggling, all illegal, not to mention entering the country illegally is a violation of law. So I say, do not boycott, litigate.\n\n\nIf people object to the Arizona law they should seek a remedy in the courts. Boycotting Arizona only hurts local businesses and communities.

Our current leaders are setting a very poor example for those of us that are up and coming.  Our government creates laws and selectively follows/enforces them and then expects the population to do as they say and not as they do.\nFor anyone who is against the law passed in Arizona, where have they been?  They should have been using the same energy to get the federal government to enforce the laws that are currently in place.\nIt seems like people at the top think of this country as their sand box and don't realize the consequences that we all face because of their actions, or lack thereof.\nIn other words, if they weren't expressing themselves to get immigration reform on the table before Arizona passed the law, they need to keep their mouth shut now.\nI really hope that good leaders can come forward and start setting our country on a better path because the spending and borrowing that has been going on now for almost a decade is very scary.\n\n\nIt is sad to see elected officials calling for boycotts, it really goes to show that many of our leaders are out of touch with main street American.\n\nArizona simply passed a law that is already a federal law.

  "text": "\n\nThe recent Arizona immigration legislation has generated heated debate and a range of responses.\nIn its statement on SB1070 the League of Arizona Cities & Towns says that \"Cities and towns provide essential services to their citizens, relying greatly on out-of-state business and tourism to improve the quality of life for their constituents. The implementation of an economic boycott to any degree will result in an inverse outcome, hurting small business, local governments and most importantly our residents.\" (http://www.azleague.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=spotlight.article&a=a052810_01)\nFor those who disagree with the state legislation, how might they express their differences without harming Arizona's local governments?\n\n",
