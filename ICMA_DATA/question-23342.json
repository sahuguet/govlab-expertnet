  "text": "\n\nWhat financial strategies are being used to fund major maintenance (capital projects) and replacement of public infrastructure other than rate-based utilities? Departments are facing a growing unfunded gap between available resources and requirements for major capital maintenance or replacement of our built infrastructure. Examples include Parks, Transportation, and Civic (fire, police, etc) facilities. A particular challenge is reliable funding for recurring and predictable major projects, such as roofing of larger buildings, plastering swimming pools, HVAC systems, etc. None of these are exciting and don't compete well with new projects, grants, or donations.\n\n",
