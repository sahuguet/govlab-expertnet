Peak Democracy's OPCFs have the order and decorum of a public hearing so they are civil, fair and legal. They also are insightful, easy to use, and costs effective. \nThe 20-40 age group is heavily comprised of people that are focused on their careers and/or families, and therefore they don't have the time or inclination to go to long, night-time public meetings.
