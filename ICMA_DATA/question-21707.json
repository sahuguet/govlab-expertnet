  "text": "\n\nHi all,\nI have a question regarding cash management and cash flow going into a City and/or County Treasurers from various City/County Departments.  Currently, we receive money from various County Departments, and hold that money in short-mid term investment accounts so that we may gain revenue, while safeguarding the principal.  The only problem is that the way County departments report to us is not at all uniform or consistent, so it makes it tough to know when departments want us to invest, and when they want their money back.  Has anyone experienced problems with lack of uniformity, and if so, how did you work to resolve the issue?  Did you create a database with which county departments reported to you with their daily expenses, and which funds they want you to investment?\nI apologize if my question lacks clarity.  If you need further clarification, please let me know.\nThank you for your time!\n\n",
