      "text": "\n\nI have had responsibilities for fleet management, in various venues, since 1982 and have had on and off experience w/ alternate fuels since 1990.  I only have rented tanks or used \"fuel cards\" or comparable contracted purchasing for interim periods when construction was underway.  It always has been cost effective in my circumstances to own the tanks, pay for them through capital projects funds,  and either bid the fuel or, if you have suffucient resources in Purchasing, to buy on the spot market.  In my current position I am midway between the NYC and Philadelphia markets and have been successful in negotiating the index prices at Philadelphia rates.  PC based fuel disensing systems are relatively inexpensive, robust and not only allow for control and chargeback of costs through whatever cost allocation plans are pertinent to you but also include leak detection, audit of deliveries to ensure against overcharging and tracking (and enforcement) of vehicle maintenance schedules.  Bottom line is that I feel I have more control over my fleet and fuel by keeping its operation in-house.   Changing tanks is anopportunity to consider conversion to alternate fules withour incurring recundant infrastructure cosats, an opportunity you may wish to consider if it is not on the table already.\n\n\nI have had responsibilities for fleet management, in various venues, since 1982 and have had on and off experience w/ alternate fuels since 1990.

We currently have fuel provided to our tanks by Fleetcor (Fuelman) on consignment, billed to us as dispensed, and transaction data with provided by Fleetcor that we upload into CCG Faster.  We are converting in the next few months to owning our own fuel which will save us $60,000 per year in fees, with little additional administrative burden.  Regulations related to UST's and AST's can be time consuming: EPA inventory monitoring and control regs, State, stormwater pollution prevention plans, spill prevention plans, etc.) but those fall to the owner regardless of who owns the fuel in the tanks.  Stockpiling fuel around our County (660 sq miles) is an integral part of emergency preparedness for us.  We have experienced snow storms when retail fueling sites simply were not open for business.  Our fuel cards are also good for purchases at Fuelman-approved retail locations when users are not convenient to  County fuel depot.  We are currently in discussions with Frederick City, the public schools and the local community college about sharing the use of fueling sites among our agencies.  Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss in more detail.\n\n\nFrederick County, MD uses 1,000,000 gallons of fuel (diesel and gasoline) per year and has 6 fueling depots, soon to be 7.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale has a fleet of approx. 1500 vehicles, including everything from autos to excavators and 15 fire engines.  We have had underground storage tanks for several years, and two years ago, purchased two fueling trucks, so that can both store fuel in the trucks, but also use the trucks to fuel vehicles anywhere in the City.  The City is part of a larger cooperative group that competes fuel supply.  Our pricing is based on what is called the OPIS index (Oil Petroleum Index Service).  Essentially, we pay cost plus a markup tied to the index. We are currently exploring hedging our fuel purchases for purposes of being able to budget fuel expenditures on a more consistent basis.\n\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale has a fleet of approx. 1500 vehicles, including everything from autos to excavators and 15 fire engines.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Collinsville is currently exploring alternative options for fueling its fleet.  The fleet includes 29 sedans (primarily police cruisers), 1 utility/service van, 42 trucks and SUVs, 2 shuttle buses, 4 ambulance or rescue transport vehicles, 3 fire engines, and 1 aerial ladder engine.  These vehicles utilize unleaded and diesel fuel.   Additionally, the City has 45 pieces of large equipment such as excavators, backhoes, utility dump trucks, street sweepers, and generators; and has 96 \u201csmall equipment units\u201d, including mowers, chain saws, weed eaters, spray machines, and snow blowers.\nCurrently, the City owns its own unleaded and diesel pumps, but an outside firm owns the above ground storage tanks and also supplies both fuels.  We are experiencing issues related to the maintenance of the above ground storage tanks which is causing issues in our police cruisers\u2019 fuel systems.\nWe would like to use this as an opportunity to explore alternative options relating to fuel supply, including:\n\u2022 Utilizing fleet cards (however this may pose an issue when fueling large equipment \u2013 excavators, backhoes, fire engines);\n\u2022 Purchasing our own storage tanks and bidding out fuel supply; and\n\u2022 Bidding/Contracting for new pumps/storage tanks and fuel supply.\nWe are interested in how other local governments manage fuel for their fleets (any of the above options, terms of agreements, anything not listed above, etc.).\nThank you for your time!\n\n",
