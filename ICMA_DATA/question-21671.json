  "text": "\n\nOur town charter specifically grants to the town council \"Section 6-5 Administration and Fiduciary Oversight of the Budget. The town council shall provide by ordinance the procedures for administration and fiduciary oversight of the budget.\" \nOne councilor introduced an ordinance that imposes a hiring freeze. The ordinance also allows the town manager to make his case that some hiring is necessary and if the council agrees they would vote to allow the hiring to proceed.\nThe Town Attorney says that violates the charter yet it is my understanding that hiring frees are a common practice on the federal, state and local levels of government.\nI would like to know how common a practice it is in the council/manager form of government and any suggestions for simple ordinance language that would accomplish such. Obviously neither the town manager or town attorney who is suppose to work for the town council as well as the town manager are against such a restriction on the executive branch.\nThank you.\nBruce\n\n",
