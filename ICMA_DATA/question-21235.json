  "text": "\n\nThe City of Connell has received correspondence and several phone messages from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) encouraging us to sign onto their License Agreement for Local Government Entities relating to the playing of music at events and functions or within municipal facilities including the tunes being played on the city phone system while citizens are on hold.\nWe are looking for specific criteria for a city to follow to determine the cases where the annual license is necessary for its organization? Or is this pretty much mandatory for cities to keep themselves from being challenged by ASCAP?\nYour input is appreciated.\nSteve Taylor, City Administrator\nCity of Connell, WA\nstevetaylor98@gmail.com\n\n",
