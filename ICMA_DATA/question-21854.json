We started with a general budget overview of process, and five year projections, then the depts presented their ideas for reductions, and the citizen group prioritized  for us. The group included local business folks, as well as former critics of the Citys' budget. When faced with best practices information w/comparsions to other cities and hard cold fiscal reality, they did an excellent job in report to City Commission. For example, we reduced fire svcs personnel by 25% (w/o push back from community or union, as the recommendations were endorsed by the citizens task force.)\n\n\nCheryl, we used a short-term task force approach...i.e. a six month Budget Task Force  (5-7 members) to review departmental submittals to reduce expenses 20 to 25% annually.

Our city wants input on prioritizing/budgeting city services. \nSpecifically, what have you used to get citizen advisory groups to help your local government identify key services?\nOr, alternatively, have you noted any best practices or innovative ways of garnering the input of Citizen Advisory Board members?\nBackground: The City of Sparks invites input from its Citizen Advisory Board in prioritizing services in this period of belt-tightening. Sparks would like to look at some best practices, award-winning, innovative methods to receive/request the Board\u2019s input.
