But, the prerequisites that I placed on the action were as follows:\n    - All hard costs incurred by the municipality would be borne by the applicant.\n    - The applicant must submit a notarized petition from all property owners along the street who would be affected by the name change, acknowledging and approving of the proposed name change and proposed date of the name change.  Further, all costs and liabilities associated with the name change are to be borne by each respective property owner.  There was also a general waiver of liability.\nIn my 18 years experience I have only seen three street name changes.  In two cases, it was a very short stub of street and the only property affected was the applicant's.  In the third case, five properties were affected, and all five signed a waiver and petition as discussed above.  That third case was in an industrial area where the street name was changed to honor the founding owner of a large manufacturing company.  Three of the five affected properties were undeveloped.\n\n\nStreet name changes have happened so infrequently in our community that we don't have a written policy for it.
