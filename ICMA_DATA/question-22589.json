  "text": "\n\nBarron County is one of two municipalities in Wisconsin that burns municipal solid waste, beginning in 1986.  The plant is now 27 years old and we are giving consideration, possibly, of a major rebuild.  \nMy question is this: does anyone have information on what it would possibly cost should we choose not to rebuild but rather to decommission?  \nplease respond to: jeff.french@co.barron.wi.us\nThank you.\n\n",
