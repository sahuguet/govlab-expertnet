I highly recommend 2010 as it brings a lot more to the table than 07. \nWe are using it in these areas:\n1. Document management\n2. Workflow\n3. Task assignment (a subset of project management)\n4. General communication\nIn the next 6 to 12 months we are going to roll out:\n1. Wikis (internal and external)\n2. Timesheets\n3. External website to share documents with public\nWe have found that a good developer is absolutely a must. Our IT guy that has done a great job at ramping up and only having 1 class but the trade off has been a longer development cycle.\nIn addition i would also recommend looking at some 3rd party add ons such as Agilepoint. We have commited to that yet but it is on our wish list.\nBest of luck!\n\n\nWe are using Sharepoint here in Safford with some success.

We have one web app for each department, one for projects, and one for the entire City, where we pull information from the departmant sites. Each department has an \"external\" site that is viewable by all departments and editable by department staff, and one or more \"internal\" sites that are only accessible by the owning department.\nWe use SharePoint for work flows (we are currently piloting an RTC work flow), projects, information sharing (interdepartmental and between departments), issue management (as part of application development, such as bugs, feature requests, test cases etc), and some \"light\" applications development. Most of our customizations are using out of the box capabilities, occasionally using SharePoint Designer.\nWe are planning to upgrade to SharePoint Standard 2010 in a few months.\n\n\nCity of Sunnyvale deployed Windows SharePoint Services 3 (WSS3) as part of Search Server Express for our intranet in late 2009.

Any feedback is great, we\u2019re specifically looking for responses on version being utilized (i.e. 2007 vs. 2010), its typical use (project management, workflow, surveys, general communication, etc) and the positives and negatives the organization has realized.
