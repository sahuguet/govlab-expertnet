We are interested in learning about any other organizations which have short-term, time-limited passes such as these so that we can find out how the produce and monitor the passes.  \nI\u2019d appreciate either information on their methods, or a contact person, or both. \nDon Schwartz\n707-565-3777\nDSCHWART@sonoma-county.org\n\n",
