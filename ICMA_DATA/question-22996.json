      "text": "\n\nLeslie, please email me and I can provide you with several presentations we have given to Council about the strategic planning process that have multiple graphics that might help give you an idea of how you want to show all the linkages.  A couple of the documents have to do with a short-term plan update we did in 2012, and one pertains to our most recent 5-year planning cycle.  Some graphics show the relationship between various input sources/activities (SWOT analysis, brainstorming, community input, etc.) and other show the relationship between the strat plan and other City planning documents (comprehensive plan, regional planning efforts).  Hope this helps! bdeleon@las-cruces.org\n\n\nLeslie, please email me and I can provide you with several presentations we have given to Council about the strategic planning process that have multiple graphics that might help give you an idea of how you want to show all the linkages.

In particular we want to show Council the linkages between all the city studies/reports/feedback we received and how that fits into the plan without listing 60 documents - and then a continuous feedback loop from that to setting direction, mission, vision, goals, etc.  \nThanks!\n\n",
