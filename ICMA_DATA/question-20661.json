The current one is adjacent to a cemetery and is being viewed as an inappropriate location. The city would like to relocate entirely, but current economic conditions have made this an improbable option. Instead, the city is working on rearranging the yard lay-out, and building retaining walls or landscaping additions. Currently the city has set aside $49,000 as of July 2010. \nEntirely new construction seems to have come to a halt in recent times. Upon surveying a basic google search, the problems associated with already established yards range from being overcrowded by machines, cars and people to structural problems.  Many cities are also finding their yards completely built-out and consequently looking to either relocate or build a second location, but again budgetary concerns are holding most cities up.\n\n\nJackson, CA is dealing is dealing with either remodeling or relocating their Corporation Yard.
