There was a rather lively and informative discussion on this very topic on the Knowledge Network 5 months ago.  \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/question/20198 \nThe substance of the original question asked is a little different from yours, but I think you'll find the ensuing dialogue between different city managers to be instructive.  \nFurthermore, the KN has an entire topic on Council-Manager relations, where you can find relevant documents, read interesting articles and network with other local government professionals who may be able to help you further.  \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/65/CouncilManager_Relations#Tab=Documents \nFor Example, I've attached to this response a report on finding respectable common ground between city managers and local elected officials.  \nHope this helps. \nDerek Johnson\n\n\nAlyssa, \n\nYou are not the first person to ask this question.
