  "text": "\n\nHello all \u2013 as you know (especially where I live/work in California) the costs associated with the salaries and retirements of public employees have become a controversial topic.  My question is, are there current examples of jurisdictions trying to reform their compensation and retirement schedules because overtime they will become too expensive???  It appears many organizations are identifying this as an issue, but are any taking strategic steps to try and rectify the situation? \nI am very interested in the dynamic between the chief executive, unions, and the elected officials of the jurisdiction.  If somebody out there can point me to a place online that may have some articles or even staff reports on this or a similar topic I would really appreciate it!\nThank you \nPatrick\n\n",
