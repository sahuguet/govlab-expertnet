  "text": "\n\nI would like to learn about other governments that are affiliated or appoint a poet laureate.   What person(s) select this poet?   How long do they serve?  Is there an honorarium?   Who 'supervises' this poet?  Do elected officials appoint the poet?    Any information would be helpful.  A quick Internet search pulled up 9 cities with P.L.'s.   Not much detail available about those programs.\nThanks!\n\n",
