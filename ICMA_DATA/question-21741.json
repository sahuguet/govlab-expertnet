What begins to happen is that employees of local businesses take the spaces and customers cannot find places to park. If you do a \"two hour maximum\" or whatever, you then find that the cars are moved every one hour and 55 minutes. Enforcement becomes a real issue.\nI guess the question is why are you considering removing the meters?  Is this a political issue?  Could replacing them with P and D equipment be an option if the meters are old and need maintenance? \nJVH\n\n\nHaving watched many municipalities go down this path, I have found that most replaced the meters or some type of charging system (Pay and display, etc) within a few years.

      "text": "\n\nJohn, \nThanks so much for responding to my question. The reason we are considering removing the meters, among three other options, is because I think there is a legitimate question as to whether the meters are needed to help facilitate vehicle turnover. \nIf we did remove our meters, regulation of parking spaces would continue. However, instead of visual verification we are considering the incorporation of a license plate recognition system. We believe this would assist our parking enforcement officer with allocating their time in a more efficient manner. \nP&D equipment is being considered in one of our four options that we will bring to council.\n\n\nJohn, \n\nThanks so much for responding to my question.

You will need to review your enforcement policies. For instance the will you alow a car to move on the same block? Same side of street? Do you have enough coverage to enforce the limit? Not just drive time, but drive time + ticket writing time+ break time. If you fall into a routine, the employees will figure it out.\n\n\nPaul- Have you picked a LPR system yet?

  "text": "\n\nThe City of River Falls is examining our current parking meter system and looking at all of the options available. We are a town of about 15,000 people and our meter system--while self-sustaining--is not a revenue generator (nor is that our goal). As such, we have not ruled out the possibility of removing our meters entirely. \nHave any Alliance members completely removed parking meters in their jurisdictions? If so, what method of vehicle-turnover did you establish in its place? How have you balanced the costs of enforcement without meter/supplemental revenue?\nThanks for your time!\n-Paul A. Fagin\n\n",
