They all have a written business attraction plan.  You will be able to tell from the column heads which survey questions and answers the spreadsheet shows. There is also contact information. Although these local governments are between 10,000 and 12,000 population, the information might still be useful to you. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at emoulder@icma.org\nBest regards,\n\n\nHi Scott,\n\nI have attached a file with the names of local governments that identified business attraction as an economic development goal and their answers to specific questions about their strategy.
