ICMA ethics obligates you to at least 2 years with any employer unless your employer makes a different decision.  Get involved in NCMA in any way your current manager will let you.  They have an excellent relationship with UNO for continuing education and a master's degree.  I would suggest that if you want to be a city manager in a larger community, a master degree is a must but be patient because all the education in the world won't make up for the experience your will get in small town America in the beginning of your career.  Good luck.\n\n\nFirst, remember your ethical responsibility to your current employer.

I'd also recommend you talk with Lowell about your desire's, he will be able to provide some work experience that is going to help with the resume and some guidance, as a \"young\" manager I am (probably should be was) always looking for the mentor relationship for people that I could call and ask a question.  The ICMA emerging leaders program, helped with that, but even now I try to find that \"veteran\" manager in the state organization that is willing to help mentor.
