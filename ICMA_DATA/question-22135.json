  "text": "\n\nThe City of Auburn is interested in hearing about any long-range studies any cities have undertaken to help plan for the facilities needed to support future growth in your government services.  We have continued to experience strong growth over the last decade and have a very active and effective economic development function, so we anticipate to continue to grow.  We are approaching capacity at several facilities, and while we have some plans for those services that are suited to satellite locations (fire stations, police substations, etc..) we are concerned with the space needs for our more centralized activities (Finance, HR, City Manager, IT etc...).  We would like to be able to identify our future land and plant needs to ensure we have sufficient space 5-20 years down the road to expand as needed.  Have any cities undertaken a comprehensive, long-range facilities plan that looks at these issues, as well as inventories existing assets in this context?\n\n",
