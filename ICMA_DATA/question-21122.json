The reason is because we believe that an informed , knowledgeable city decision maker or influencer is better and this results in better RFPs/RFQs and better technology implementation. A failed project is bad for business even if we're not the vendor as a successful project is good for business; and frankly - we've had to fix a lot of the failed projects. I've spoken to my technology partners and they support initiatives like these as well and often times underwrite them ( with no strings attached no advertising no banners, etc.) I think that this is something that Munis must require of the vendor community especially with the economic challenges you face today.\n\n\nElliot, \nI can't speak for other vendors, but we ( NetLogix) offer free vendor agnostic seminars/webinars on the types of technology that we offer - no sales pitch.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Watertown is exploring ways to better train staff in order to address gaps in our technology training. We have many software packages in place and desire to use them as effectively as possible but without spending a lot of money sending individuals to training seminars or relying on faceless manuals.\nHas anyone out there explored this issue in their municipality, and can you relay how you increased your staffs\u2019 technological proficiency? What did you find most effective, and what did you find that was ineffective? Any information on past and current practices would be helpful and appreciated.\n\n",
