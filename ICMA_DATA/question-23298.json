You are not going to change the world merely with your presence.  Second, listen, listen, listen to those around you.  Don't come into the situation like a bull in a china closet thinking that you are the only one with answers.  \nIf you do this, you are destined to isolate yourself and you cannot do it alone.  If you do employ listening skills, humility and sound decision making, you will be sought out as a leader.\n\n\nLooking back 20 years ago, I would recommend two things to new managers that I learned very quickly.
