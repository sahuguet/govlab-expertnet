  "text": "\n\nFor those of you with a cemetery, have you developed a master plan?  Our organization assumed the responsibilities of a local cemetery and we would like to develop a long-range/master plan for it.  It is approximately 30 acres of which only half has been surveyed.  I am interested in ideas for laying out plots, designing the landscape, niche gardens or columbiums, and etc.  If so, could you please explain your process (i.e. public input, hire consultant, etc.)?  Would you mind sharing it?\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
