The City hired a temporary Farmer's Market Coordinator who worked through issues pertaining to booth costs and the tough one of ensuring that farmers that would consistently show up.  The Market has been running for several years and appears to be getting more popular as the years go by.  If I recall, the City utilizes its own insurance carrier for the event, but I'm not positive.  A good contact is Council Member Bill Peloza at bpeloza@auburnwa.gov as he is still there and was an original organizer of the event.\nRegards,\nAaron Nix\n\n\nYes, we started and they continue the Farmer's Market at their Park and Ride facility in the City of Auburn, WA.
