Along with shifting some of the contribution costs from the state to the current employees the restructuring also reduced the cost of living adjustments current retirees get from 3.5% per year to a more modest 2% year over year. The biggest change was the cost of living adjustment being put on hold for one whole year. A one year 3.5% savings compounded year over year can have a significant impact on the balance of the pension plan. The article below was written just after the legislation passed the state senate but I know it made it out of the Colorado House virtually unchanged. I am also attaching a separate article detailing how the initiatives have already had positive results for the solvency of the plan. \nI also know that similar efforts are being undertaken in Minnesota.\nhttp://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/991586-state-pension-plan-reform-passes-senate\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=11415137\n\n\nAlex, \nYou should check out some of the work that state policy makers have done in Colorado.

Oregon did the nation's most dramatic pension overhaul in 2003, requiring new employees to have about 1/3 of their benefit in a 401(k) type plan, where the state manages the investment. I am attaching a document that speaks of the plan in detail. Other states that you may want to examine are Rhode Island, Kentucky, New York and New Jersey.\n\n\nIn addition, you may want to look at Oregon.
