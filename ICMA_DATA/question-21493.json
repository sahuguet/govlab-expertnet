  "text": "\n\nBeing that new narrowbanding requirements will go into effect as of January 1, 2013 the city of Whitewater Wisconsin will be taking steps to meet those requirements in the upcoming year.  My question is for municipalities that have either already updated, or are in the process of updating their systems.  How was your municipality able to meet those requirements?  What vendors were used, and were you able to work with surrounding municipalities/counties when purchasing new equipment and updating existing radios?\n\n",
