Of course, staffing for any City is dependent upon a number of factors, including but not limited types and level of services provided, financial resources and local politics. For example, I mentioned that ENM has only 2 full-time PW employees supplemented by 3 seasonal employees. Most communities of our size in our region that provide similar PW services have departments 3-4 times larger from a staffing standpoint. Are we understaffed? No - lean, but not understaffed. In our case, a significant amount of our infrastrcuture is relatively new, requiring less maintenance. This has allowed us to provide the desired level for service with less resources. However, as it ages, we are seeing and increasing demand for resources and expect PW staffing to increase. Similarly, our PD is 3-4 times smaller than surrounding local departments in similarly sized communities. However, our call load is relatively low and do not prvide the same level of service. In short, I do not belive that there is a \"rule of thumb\" for staffing levels in smaller communities.
