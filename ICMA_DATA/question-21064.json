I imagine there would have to be some qualifiers, for instance to balance wealthy communities versus low income communities because a low income or low revenue community could be very efficient and doing well with the revenues available; perhaps the measurement could be segmented into classes of communities, such as those with high appraised values, those that do not offer full services, etc. This project could be a really difficult task, especially if you want to make it bullet proof. I am unaware of any existing measures that are as universal as what you are looking for.\n\n\nPaul, I think the common denominators are revenue and services, with that in mind I would start with a \"services cost per capita\".

For efficiency measures, I would suggest pairing cost with an industry standard.  For example, in the fire service, pair cost with a determination if a community is underserved, adequately served or overserved per NFPA and ISO standards.  If you found underserved, high per capita cost community, that would be a good indicator of potential inefficiency.\n\n\nPaul, in NY, we've used a per capita cost as a measure to identify services with a high cost but that's not always a measure of efficiency.

Maybe it is cost per capita balanced against a service level indicator, whic might address Robert's and Sean's concerns. for instance: Sample: Pavement condition would be a balance of cost per capita and what the pavement codition standard is... translation would be how much people are willing to pay for what road condition. Maybe using this we could look at efficiency vs crime levels, efficiency vs EMS outcomes,  etc.??\n\n\nIt seems like there needs to be a balancing of measures while keeping it minimal.

By just focusing on the money per service to see that providing the service is comparable to other benchmarked localities, we are losing sight of the actual goal.\nThe goal being are the services we are providing to our citizens, are they doing what we want? That should be the first question. If the answer to that question is yes, then we move on to the financial metrics. However, if the answer to that question is no, the financial metrics do not matter to the elected bodies we report to. \nInstead of focusing on a per dollar cost, we (financial people and non financial people) need to focus on if the service we are providing is doing what the elected body wants it to. That is the first item we have to measure.\nFor example, a road maintenance program. The first question should be, are we maintaining our roads to the public's satisfaction? If the answer is no, we must look at the root causes as to why we are not providing the service the public expects. It may be financial, or it may be something else. But, we have to first answer that tough question before we automatically jump into metrics to explain.\n\n\nFrom the answers provided it appears that we are just taking a financial approach to the answer to this question. this is the easiest manner to understand and present to our elected Board's and Commissions, but I would argue it is doing a huge disservice to those very same Board's and Commissions.

At the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement, we've been striving for some time now to find as tight a list of measures as possible to assess local government performance. In talking with local government leaders across the US, what we've found is that there is no single measure (or even 2 or 3) that seems to fit the bill.\nWhat we know for sure, though, is that many leaders are drowning in information and need help assessing performance as thoroughly as possible with as few measures as possible. In talking with them, we've learned that 3-5 measures in each key service area seems to meet the needs of most senior leaders (although, of course, their operational managers usually need much more in-depth information).\nIn response to this need, we just launched CPM 101, a new streamlined approach to comparative performance measurement, which offers a set of approximately 100 performance measurement questions intended to help senior leaders assess the key aspects of local government performance.\nThanks for sparking this very relevant discussion!\n\n\nPaul-This is a great question!

  "text": "\n\nI would like to find a universal (at least universal for the US) measure of OVERALL local government efficiency. Efficiency is usually defined as inputs vs. outputs. I have a few in mind, but wanted to ask a broad audience if they had any suggestions. I'm looking for 2 - 3 measures that would brush a broad picture of how efficiently a local government is operating. It should be a measure I could use to compare a small town in Washington State to LA County, to Baltimore, to Broward County FL.... I'm willing to take as many examples as you can think of. If you know of any published studies that have already determined some fair measures of efficiency that can be used to compare local governments, that would be even better. Let me know! Thanks for the help.\n\n",
