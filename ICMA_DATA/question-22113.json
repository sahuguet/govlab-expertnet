You mention he/she charged you to \u201creview the files,\u201d yet it seems that you were charge as well for the time to retrieve them from a distant location.  \nWould you dispute both types of charges? \nFrom my experience attorneys tend to charge for every hour , or fraction thereof, of work they or any of their staff/associates put into a project for a client, even copying a few pages to send to a client, so the charge to retrieve, copy, and send them to you does not surprise me.   I would possibly question the time and especially the need to \u201creview them.\u201d   I can think of some reasons why he/she might want/have to do this, but I would like to hear it from them.\n\n\nFirst, I would inquire for a breakdown of the charges.

Among the legal profession there are standards of ethics governing such changes.  I have been part of several such changes but not for all municipal work and we let the new firm deal with the old firm.  The only circumstance where this could have different implications would be matters of extreme sensitivity and confidentiality where the old firm might have legitimate interests in vetting documents to assure they are not left with any liability but even then it should be able to be handled between the 2 firms.\n\n\nWhat about the new firm?

I asked for all files from the former attorney created on our behalf to be returned to my organization. \nThe former attorneys said that many of the files were located off site in a storage facility.\nUpon return of the files, I was presented with a bill for the cost of the attorney to review the files.\nIt is my belief that since we paid for the work, the files are ours and should be returned without charge. No extraordinary expenses were incurred by the former law firm.\nI would appreciate your thoughts.\n\n",
