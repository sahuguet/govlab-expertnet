      "text": "\n\nDear Mr. Sorrel, If you can find the first edition of the legislative process textbook by Malcolm Jewell and Samuel Patterson (which was published in the 1970s, I think), there is a chapter devoted to the various ways in which legislators view their jobs (is my chief responsibility to speak up for my constituents, develop innovative solutions to problems, help to resolve political conflicts, make everyone play by the proper rules, etc.?) and related topics.  I think you could probably develop a fairly good job definition from that material.  Let me know if you have trouble finding it, and I'll send you a xerox of the chapter.  You might need something a bit more specific, but it would be a start.\n\n\nDear Mr. Sorrel, If you can find the first edition of the legislative process textbook by Malcolm Jewell and Samuel Patterson (which was published in the 1970s, I think), there is a chapter devoted to the various ways in which legislators view their jobs (is my chief responsibility to speak up for my constituents, develop innovative solutions to problems, help to resolve political conflicts, make everyone play by the proper rules, etc.?) and related topics.
