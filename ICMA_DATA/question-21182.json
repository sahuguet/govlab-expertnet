It is surprising how many municipalities do not have a transition plan at all, or have one that is two decades old.   Age of the current plan, age and size of your municipality, and even geography can have tremendous affects on cost.  Here is a link at which you can view the transition plan for the City of Wichita, KS.  Each hyperlink will take you to a different city facility, and the plan is composed of all components, collectively.  http://www.wichita.gov/ContactUs/ADA/TransitionPlan.htm\n(In my review before sending this out, I see that although our work toward the plan completion has continued, our documentation of that work needs some catch-up. ) Feel free to contact me directly with questions.  jhinkel@wichita.gov. \nJay Hinkel\n\n\nMary,\nYou did not say when your transition plan was last updated.

Our Transition Plan covers all city-owned properties where city services, programs and activities are provided.  This includes, but is not limited to, office buildings, parks, Police and Fire stations, libraries, parking facilities, golf courses, and airports.  \nThe City contracted with a professional consultant in the spring of 2007 to review all aspects of our plan and inspect all of our facilities where services, programs and activities are offered.  Individual reports were provided for each location (approximately 275) with a brief description of the problem and the pertinent portion of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG).  The Transition Plan was adopted by our City Council in September 2008.  Because we have individual reports for each location, we do not need to revise our Transition Plan \u2013 we just need to update the Barrier Removal Dates and the pertinent portion of the new 2010 ADA standards.\nDepartment Heads are required to update those reports pertaining to their department every six months.  Copies of the individual Barrier Removal Target Reports are available upon request.  \nInitial cost of the self-evaluation, physical inspection and preparation of the 275 reports (we were provided both hard and electronic copies of every report) was $250,000.\nA combined example of our plan and a couple of the individual reports are attached.\nPaula Falkenstein\npaula.falkenstein@okc.gov\n\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City adopted a Transition Plan in 1992.

  "text": "\n\nGood morning,\nThe Department of Justice has revised title II and title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Title II applies to state and local government services and accessibility standards. Title II applies to commercial buildings. The effective compliance date for new standards is March 15, 2012.\nThe ADA suggests creating an ADA transition plan as a step towards compliance. Have any of your organizations recently updating their ADA transition plans? If so, did you create the plan in house or contract out the work? What was the approximate cost and staff time needed? Also, could you attach your updated transition plan as a sample?\nInformation on the revised ADA can be found on the ADA website. I also helped this guide helpful: http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleII_2010/titleII_2010_regulations.htm.\nThank you in advance for any assistance.\nBest,\nMary Van Milligen\n\n",
