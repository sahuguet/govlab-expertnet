Now, the jurisdiction may allow the exempt employee to work one hour during the day, and take the rest of the day off without utilizing any banked vacation or sick leave, but as exempt employees if you are tracking Compensatory (Comp) time, you are making yourself an hourly employee that is now subject to all the rules that being an hourly employee entails.\nEven if your jurisdiction allows this time, as an exempt employee you should not be earning or using comp time. You can have the time off if your employment agreement allows it but be careful that you do not jeopardize your exempt status by tracking hours like an hourly employee.\n\n\nJust a point of clarification, if the employee is an exempt employee, they are not entitled to Compensatory Time as defined by FLSA.

But even in its day, most managers did not believe that they would be entitled to hour for hour comp time. Here is the new language: \nSection 13: Hours of Work\nIt is recognized that the Employee must devote a great deal of time outside the normal office hours on business for the Employer, and to that end Employee shall be allowed to establish an appropriate work schedule.\nUnder Section 5 we added this an an option: \n1.
