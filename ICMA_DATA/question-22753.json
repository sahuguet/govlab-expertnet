We determined a few things: they are very useful when their functionality is really thought out, it should be used as a means to improve efficiency and not replace people, it can cut down on wait times and provide up-to-date information on subjects, they require some resources to set-up and requires regular supervision.  They are great if designed and used properly!\nI designed the system using a variety of tools, but it was web based in architecture.\n\n\nHi Edward, While I was with the New York State Courts (I am a tech consultant now), I designed several kiosk systems as tests.

  "text": "\n\nOur city is currently researching the feasibility of installing computer kiosks at various city facilities to assist our customers with routine transactions/information requests. These kiosks would be much like the automated kiosks you would find at airports, malls, etc which provide routine informational/transactional services that customers can use. \nWe would be interested in hearing from agencies that have implemented public kiosks and whether you would recommend them as a tool to assist customers. Our vision is a system which can provide the following services:\n1) Directions to various departments/facilities\n2) Request routine transactions - pay bills, request records, reserve classes, etc.\n3) Provide information on upcoming events, council meetings, etc.\n4) Serve as public notification for meetings and provide information on various topics on agenda's\n5) ?????\nWe'd be interested in finding out details of your implementation and whether you think the kiosks were a success in delivering service to your community.\nThank you.\n\n",
