  "text": "\n\nHow does a better organized fleet system help save money on parts, repairs and improve the longevity of each vehicle? And how much money can be saved?\nAll of our city vehicles are worked on/maintained and fueled at an inhouse city owned shop (oil changes, tires, brakes, general maintenance). I'm looking for information on a Fleet Management System that will help us track inventory, fuel usage, maintenance schedules, and retirement schedules. GPS tracking is not necessary. I'm also hoping to obtain research on Fleet Management Systems that include data.\n\n",
