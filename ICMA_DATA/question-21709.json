  "text": "\n\nIn October 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a sweeping digital inclusion initiative to increase broadband connectivity and Internet access across the nation in order to boost our competitive advantage in the world economy. \nBut what does digital inclusion look like in your community?  Do you know what digitally inclusive activities are undertaken in your community?  What are your priorities for getting started or continuing existing efforts? What are the challenges and successes you encountered? To help answer these questions, ICMA in partnership with IMLS, WebJunction, and TechSoup Global, have developed an assessment that looks broadly across the landscape of digital inclusion.\nThis assessment serves a purely public purpose and is not connected to any commercial enterprise.\nResults will be shared with all survey takers, and inform the programs and supporting materials developed to advance efforts to help your community and others across the country. \nThe survey will take about 15 minutes to complete and can be found here: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Digital-communities\n\n",
