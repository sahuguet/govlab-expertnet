  "text": "\n\nAre there people that can share their city\u2019s experiences using hotlines to take questions and respond to complaints related to construction? Specifically, we are interested in cities that have had several large scale capital improvement projects underway simultaneously that have used hotlines to address citizen concerns about construction impacts. Information about what structure worked well would be very helpful, including questions such as: run internally vs. contracted out; providing recorded information and/or connection to a real person; a voicemail box vs. an operator; promised response time to inquiries; systems for funneling emergency calls or calls of a very urgent nature to another line.\n\n",
