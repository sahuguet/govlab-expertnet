Hopefully you'll get some good feedback.\nI think you'd be wise to be flexible at this juncture - go ahead and expand your job search to all available positions (within reason, anyways).  Even if you end up in a position that wasn't your first choice, it would be a good way to get your foot in the door somewhere and begin developing some of your professional skills.  However, if you do accept a position, I think you should plan to stick around for at least a year or two, probably the latter, as this will demonstrate loyalty and commitment.  Wherever you end up, you should be clear that you are willing to try different things, but that you have your sights set on a specific goal (for example, you may be shooting for an analyst position, or an Assistant to position).  That way, if the opportunity does present itself, you will be more likely to be considered.\nGood luck!\nTom\n\n\nScott,\n\nThis is a good question - I'm glad you posted it.

What the job provided me was tenure in local government, access to a well respected manager, access to a network of managers, learning how a small community really works. 16 months after that appointment, I was a borough manager, at age 25, with a paid fire dept, two sewer plants and a water plant. You cannot get that kind of hands on experience in any other type of community (smaller is better, less is more, etc). All too often, I see younger professionals thinking that they can get the best jobs right out of school, working in the best communities. It took me nearly 15 years before I felt confident enough to get that right job, one where I could put all my training and experience to work in a community that was looking for someone to help it redefine itself. During those 15 years, I worked in the borough (pop. 6,000), as an assistant manager in a community of 60,000, as a finance director in a community of 65,000 that underwent a change in the form of government. The cumulative experience in these diverse communities gave me the opportunity to acquire my dream job.\nPut your time in, broaden your experience and skills, be flexible.
