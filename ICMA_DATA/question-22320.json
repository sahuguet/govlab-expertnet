  "text": "\n\nI am from a very small town and we are writing a subdivision Ord.  In it I said that all Planning Commissioners would visit the site prior to either approval or not of the subdivision plan.\nThe other Planning Commissioners feel they just need to send a representative and make their decision off of the opinion of one person or they might just go off of the map provided.\nI said, no we all needed to go to all sites as it provides consistency and validity to any determination about future subdivisions and let everyone on the commission ask reasonable questions since all member were there.  \nAs we are a small town besides the above, I feel not having everyone go to the possible future subdivision site might cause future problems through the publics perception of consistency of site visits.\nI have looked through my ethics book and cannot find an example to show the other commissioners.\nAm I wrong?\n\n",
