Every project in our capital program gets ranked, however, there are a number of other criteria considered (funding source, operational impacts, political environment, etc.)  \nAttached you will find the criteria we use.  We ask departments to rank each criteria on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest.  We also include some definitions for each criteria.\nAlso, while it is a helpful tool for looking at the nuances between projects and across project types, it does have it's limitations.   For example, the criteria tends to favor the larger regional projects.  For this reason, we have also created a \"Community Works\" project that encompasses a number of smaller neighborhood based projects that have an immediate impact on the neighborhoods.  We fund about $1 million a year and these usually include small street projects (sidewalk improvements, Traffic mitigation projects, quick response projects) and quality of life projects (landscape improvements, park improvements, signage).  We have found that these small projects have an immediate and significant positive impact on our residents. \nI have attached a screen shot of the criteria.\n\n\nThe City of Peoria, AZ uses a ranking system as one tool to prioritize projects.
