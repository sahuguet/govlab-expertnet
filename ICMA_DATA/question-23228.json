  "text": "\n\nHello All, \nOur City is considering adopting an incentiveprogram for employees who submit innovative ideas that may save money, improve efficiency, enhance safety, etc. We currently have an employee recognition program but would like to develop a program specifically for  innovative ideas. Our Quality Team, recently rebranded as our Innovation and Continual Excellence Team, will administer the program.\nI would appreciate any insights  regarding these types of programs and the rewards given to employees. Also, any successes and obstacles with the program administration would be appreciated as well. \nThank you in advance for your help!\nBest,\nMcKinlee Ritter\nCity of West Des Moines\n\n",
