This is a long winded way of suggesting that the best way to start finding an appriopriate form is the ask bond counsel that the city provides for a copy of the check list it uses to assure that a capital bond issue is in compliance because such a check list can be a great starting point.\n\n\nMy experience with compliance tracking is both city and county in several states, and that is the foremost challenge tied to audit of capital projects especially those financed through some form of bond because there is compliance tracking (making sure the promises made in the bond to the IRS and bond holders are met) and there is financial performance (i.e. consistent with state and municipal codes, bidding, etc.) My experience in performance tracking is that while I was not and am not CPA qualified my work product actually proved to be 90 per cent of an acceptable audit especially with the aspect of assuring that how the money was pledge to be sent was so spent.

  "text": "\n\nHow does your city handle internal auditing for capital projects? We are looking to establish a form to use so that we can have better consistency in our audits. Currently there is too much discretion involved on the part of the finance manager. We would like to get sample forms, if any one has them, or some ideas on your process. Thanks!\n\n",
