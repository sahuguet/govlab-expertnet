A policy reflects and specifies the desired outcomes of the governing body. Policies provide the framework needed to coordinate and execute the jurisdiction\u2019s activities and help to focus attention and resources on high priority issues, aligning and merging efforts to achieve the goals of the Board or Council. \nProcedures are the operational processes required to implement the Board/Council direction. Procedures are often a series of steps to be followed to accomplish the desired end result. The manager implements the governing body\u2019s policies through various procedures; they can be formal or informal, specific to a department or applicable across the government. \nTogether policies and procedures can clarify goals and desired outcomes and provide staff responsible with the direction and consistency they need to successfully improve processes. A policy describes \"what\" the governing body wants accomplished and \u201cwhy\u201d.  It is generally expressed in broad terms, address major issues, require Board/Council action and therefore change infrequently.  Procedures describe processes, \u201chow\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d and sometimes \u201cwho\u201d will implement the policy.  They are often very detailed and may change frequently in response to changing conditions. Procedures are changed with approval of the manager and generally do not require action by the governing body.\n\n\nOver the years and in a variety of local government and school settings I've found the following to be a useful definition of, and distinction between, policy and procedure.  \n\nA policy provides guiding principles setting direction for the operations of the local government.

We are in the process of creating council subcommittees and want to be clear that they deal with POLICY rather than operatioal or administrative matters.
