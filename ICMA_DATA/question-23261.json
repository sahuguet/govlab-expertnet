The company I work for, Community Green Energy, which is located in Lake Geneva, WI, works with communities to develop solar energy solutions, with an emphasis on developing community solar projects: https://communitygreenenergy.com/community-virtual-solar-garden/ .\nWisconsin does present some hurdles to municipalities looking to install solar, mainly because the third party ownership model is currently unavailable, though that may change in the near future.  I'd be happy to discuss solar options available in Wisconsin further with you, just feel free to reach out to me at dthurnau@theadmincenter.com.\nDavid Thurnau\n\n\nHello Andy,\nIt's good to hear that Wisconsin municipalities are considering solar.
