  "text": "\n\nI am doing research on the product Chatter by SalesForce. I have heard that it can be used to develop interdepartmental relations and break down \"silos\" in an organization. It looks like this product is geared mostly for the private sector, but some municipalities do use it.\nI just wanted to see if anyone had any experience with this product or know certain things about it's effectiveness. The product can be found here: http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/features/ \nThanks!\n\n",
