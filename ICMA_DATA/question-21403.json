  "text": "\n\nThe City of Westerville, Ohio is interested in creating a formal policy or program to put into place for managing our Supplemental Insurance providers (short-term disability, cancer policies, etc.).  We would be very appreciative if anyone could provide us with information or policy that your community may have when it comes to management of these providers.\nSome of the issues specifically that would be helpful are:\n\n1)  Is there is any formal screening process conducted by the employer;\n2)  Does your community have a limitation on the # of such vendors that have payroll deduction privileges for enrolled employees:\n3)  What direct access is granted to market/sell to the employees (eg. on-site presentations, during or after business hours, annual presence at health and wellness fairs).\n\nWesterville currently has approximately seven vendors that our employees work with in this regard and we would find it useful to create a policy for managing these vendors and potential future vendors.\nThank you,\n\nKyle\n\nKyle Kridler\nManagement Intern\nCity of Westerville\n21 S.
