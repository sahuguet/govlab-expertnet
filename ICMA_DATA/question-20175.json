Our City Manager had the Leadership Team read the book \"The Price of Government\" and present on 3 techniques we would recommend implementing within the organization.  One of which I presented on was Outcome based budgeting and its overall concept.  I have attached that part of my presentation for you.  The book was really helpful actually so I went ahead and scanned the appropriate pages for any of you that are interested and have attached it.\nThe City of Fort Collins follows outcome based budgeting pretty closely.  Visit their website at http://www.fcgov.com/bfo/ \nI also found a document that the David Osborne wrote (Author of Price of Government) that seems to also be a great guide.  On page 2 of the document it lists examples of sates, counties, school districts and cities that have utilized this budgeting method.  I hope this seems to help!!\nIf you all find additional information, feel free to share...  It would be greatly appreciated!  Have a great day!\n\n\nI am also very interested in any material you should find.

Mainly, the largest one is that going to a outcome-based or zero-based or whatever you want to call it, is going to upset the current apple cart. Many departments and people are going to be upset if their department or program is seen as not being overly cost-effective. The elected officials need to be able to rely upon the data to determine if departments are doing more with less, and then they can put resources to the areas where they are most effective.\nThe State of Washington has attempted something similar, the Priorities of Government, and during the boom times it appeared to work, but now that revenues are down, the Legislature and the Governor have abandoned it because to truly be effective it will affect certain constituency groups.\nI did my thesis on performance-based budgeting for my MBA, and it is a tremendous tool for government, but it adds a large amount of time on the front-end of the budgeting process, and without stakeholder buy-in it is doomed to failure. Don't get me wrong, I love it, and when I was an elected official myself, I attempted to utilize portions of these ideals, but I ended up offending too many constituency groups, so other elected official's in my county were afraid to utilize it.\n\n\nI applaud your jurisdiction for attempting this, however there are many pitfalls.

I've researched outcome-based budgeting quite a bit and I still don't get it entirely.\nIn the private sector, the concept makes a lot of sense.  Your budget doesn't drive your production, your demand does... so you budget for the desired outcome, which is where the supply and demand curve meet.  In government, I suppose you can do the same if you identify a) what outcomes the governing body/public desire, b) what level of outputs it takes to produce those outcomes, and c) what level of inputs it requires to yield said output.  Then you can show some specific examples, but I think starting with the business model will engage people because folks get that.  \nThrough that analogy, you can lead into some flowcharts and get your point across, I think.\n\n\nIf you do find something, I'd love to see it.

I hope outcome based budgeting would increase my success in prioritizing our services.\n\n\nI am interested in learning more about outcome based budgeting.

If you normal budgeting process takes 3-4 months, then if you are implementing an outcome-based or performance-based budgeting model, stretch the time necessary to prepare for the budget to 11-12 months. This sounds daunting, but to truly do it right and provide your elected board with the data they need to make tough decisions, you will have to do it.\nThe other thing is that there are services that a government provides that are not efficient, Parks & Rec, Senior Centers, etc, but your elected board will want the data on the performance of these areas, but they will not cut them regardless of what the data shows. If you go into this process knowing that there are some untouchable political items, it will help you in the entire budgeting process.\nI hope it goes well, it is a very difficult process to implement, but once implemented, it provides reams of data for elected officials and other stakeholders.\n\n\nPaul makes a very good and salient point.
