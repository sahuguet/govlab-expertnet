While ICMA resources may be helpful, I suggest you contact some of the Idaho counties that operate under the form of government Kootenai is considering.  Ideally, you could find not only county administrators, but a few folks from those communities who could speak candidly about the advantages and disadvantages.  Good luck... moving away from a raft of elected offices is often tough sledding.\n\n\nAs a native of Libby, Montana, and a long-time resident of Spokane, I appreciative some of the dynamics.

  "text": "\n\nKootenai county Idaho is proposing to put changing the form of county gov. On the November ballot.  They are proposing to hire an administrator and appoint some now elected positions such as the treasurer, assessor, coroner and clerk.   The change is spelled out in Idaho code as an alternative form.  I think this will be beneficial in many ways.  A \"good\" administrator would provide some continuity to county operations and also, as a trained administrator, but more skilled at managing county operations.\nThere is a growing group who see the potential change as adding additional layers of bureaucracy and reducing the publics opportunity to elect some positions.\nI want this to work and am looking for support in telling the benefits of a county manager.  Any help will be appreciated.  Thank you so much.\n\n",
