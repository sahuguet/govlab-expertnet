Small towns have been largely ignored in the research literature, and your participation will greatly aid in the understanding of politics in that realm.\nIf you are a city administrator in a small town (population less than 20,000), we hope you will share with us your perspective on political patronage in small town America.  The survey is a simple multiple-choice questionnaire that should only take about five minutes to complete.  Participation is strictly voluntary and your responses will be kept in strict confidence.  Because the results of the survey will be aggregated, your responses are not individually identifiable in any way.  Your anonymity and privacy will be protected.\nThe survey can be accessed via the following link.  Additional instructions will be provided there.\nSurvey Link \uf0e8  http://tltc.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_1ZhGcVtqFAvRURS\nThe deadline has been extended to January 27, 2012.\nA summary of the research results is available upon request.\nIf you have any questions, we can be reached at:\nDwight Gard, Ph.D.       email address:  dwight.gard@ttu.edu\nDavid Hamilton, Ph.D.        email address:  david.hamilton@ttu.edu\nThank you very much for your cooperation.
