  "text": "\n\nColleagues:  Bowie's police department is only 4 years.  The implementation is going well.  A councilmember has suggested the city should have a police advisory board or some sort of citizen oversight committee.  My reaction four years ago was that civilian review boards are generally found in larger cities (100,000 pop. and up) and that we did not, and still do not, have the kinds of problems that typically are catalysts for creating these groups/committees/boards.  I am interested in hearing if such entities exist in any Maryland jurisdictions.  thanks much\nDavid Deutsch\nBowie, MD\n\n",
