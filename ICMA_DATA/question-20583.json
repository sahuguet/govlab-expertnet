  "text": "\n\nHow many cities have already applied to IBM Smarter Cities Challenge or are considering it?  \nIf you have not heard about it yet, click here: https://smartercitieschallenge.org/index.html\nIBM is awarding $50 million in enhanced technology and problem solving IT resources.  The application is on a tab on the link above.\nI know this is a competive process with IBM, but after the close of the challenge, it would be wonderful if a winning city could post their application.  Web 2.0 is huge right now and many firms are considering projects similar to IBM.  As cities focus more activity on the grant/contest writing functions, knowledge exchange could be very helpful.  Share details from your winning proposals.\nThanks.\n\n",
