  "text": "\n\nWe are looking for examples of RFP's that Cities have issued to recruit third party operators of municipal facilities, specifically a Multigenerational Center and Aquatics center. The City of Maricopa is building a facility and has received Council direction to explore having a third party manage operations of the facility. Council has also encouraged that these partnerships be with nonprofit organizations and stressed that the City have ultimate control of the center. We are having a difficult time reconciling how to accomplish these goals while also giving full management responsibility to a separate entity.\n\n",
