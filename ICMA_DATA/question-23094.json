  "text": "\n\nOur organization is exploring the idea of creating a policy for when employees and departments support local nonprofits using county resources (email, staff time).  We know there is a public good/benefit to supporting our local nonprofits and would like to encourage our employees to be active within the community, however we'd like to have an internal policy document that guides when county resources, such as email and staff time, can be used to support local clothing and food drives, charity races/Relay for Life events, etc.\nAre there any communities that have internal policies that describe a process for approving the use of organizational resources to encourage employee volunteerism and support of local nonprofits?  Is this a good idea?\n\n",
