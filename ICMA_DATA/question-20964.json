  "text": "\n\nThe City has recently received a federal grant that is being passed thru to a local non-profit agency.  Currently, we do not have a standard \"sub-recipient\" agreement that can be utilized to communicate the federal, state and local requirements that go along with a federal pass-thru grant.  Does anyone have such standard agreement that they regularly utilize to contract with sub-recipients on federal grants?\n\n",
