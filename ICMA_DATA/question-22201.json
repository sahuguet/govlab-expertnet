  "text": "\n\nFacebook recently started making local governments change their Facebook page name from a location to something else. Gainesville, FL was \u201cCity of Gainesville, FL\u201d and has since changed it to \u201cCity of Gainesville, FL \u2013 where every path starts with passion\u201d which is the tag line on the city logo. City representatives are hoping to change to something shorter. Have any of you found a creative Facebook page name for your city or county government? Please respond here or directly to tmiller@transformgov.org.  \nBest Regards,  \nTracy Miller  \nFlorida Regional Director  \nAlliance for Innovation\n\n",
