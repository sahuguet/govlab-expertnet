I suspect that you are referring to the department, as opposed to the elected board or chief administrative officer. Also not knowing the specific function of the department may limit responses. Regardless, what you propose is important, and should be welcomed by the organization and the public that it serves. You might consider the information in these links. I know some will just lead you further into research, but fact is there is no shortage of information on ethics policies and their overall effectiveness. You also may have access to a local college engaged in public sector ethics and accountability.\nBest of Luck,\nLarry DiRe\nhttp://www.aspanet.org/public/ASPA/Publications/Public_Integrity/ASPA/Publications/Public_Integrity1/Public_Integrity1.aspx?hkey=a12ece24-6382-495f-aa4c-f4861e375513\nhttp://www.miamidade.gov/ethics/library/ethics_conference_program.pdf\nhttp://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/13/1899138.pdf\nhttp://www.mesharpe.com/mall/resultsa.asp?Title=Ethics+in+Public+Management#comments\nhttp://academic.udayton.edu/RichardGhere/MPA%20524/2011%20course/05Ghere.pdf\nhttp://academic.udayton.edu/RichardGhere/MPA%20524/2011%20course/syl%20ethics%202011.html\n\n\nHi Brandon,\nIt might be helpful if we had a clearer understanding of the \"they\" that you reference.

  "text": "\n\nHello i was wondering if you could give me some advice. I am currently attempting to write a policy memo which suggests that having a ethics policy is beneficial to the department. My problem is that they are asking for data or statistics that  supports the effectiveness of such a policy. I do not know where to look to find that information. Do you have any suggestions.\nBrandon Wilson\n\n",
