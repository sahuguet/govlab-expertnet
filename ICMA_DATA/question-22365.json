      "text": "\n\nMichael,\nThose are well-developed questions to ask.  Did your governing board express similar concerns when they tasked you to find increased citizen input.  Not knowing specifics about your particular situation please accept my comments as a general approach.  First, it may be difficult for the citizens' committee to perform their budgetary work and determine their own mission statement.  The governing board should develop and approve the mission statement to demonstrate their buy-in to the process they have tasked.  If the citizens' committee is expected to develop the mission statement it takes away from their specific task and allows the governing board to nitpick and second guess the committee.  That is a recipe for frustration for all involved.  Second, my default is to have a committee as broad-based as possible so the committee has credibility with the community.  Now, if the primary interest is in having a citizens' committee that has credibility with the governing board you may want to use more of a hand-picked character.  In either event you may want to  ensure that all activities of the citizens' committee are public and transparent.  Third, if your county is already utilizing department-level performance\\best practices data to make budgetary decisions then that should be the focus of the citizens' committee.  If your county is using more of a line-item incrementalist budgetary process then that should be the committee's focus.  I would recommend against them trying to implement department-level analysis if that is not already going on.  Fourth, ideally they should be involved from the time departments are asked to develop next FY draft budget so that they have access to complete information to work with.  Ideally they should report out at the governing board's budget public hearing and call it a job done after that report. \nJust some thoughts.  Great question and I look forward to learning from other posted comments.  Best of luck to you, your residents and the community.\n\n\nMichael,\nThose are well-developed questions to ask.

  "text": "\n\nMy Fellow Managers,\nMy Board of Commissioners wants more citizen input into the budget process; as such, I\u2019ve tasked my finance director with finding places that have successfully utilized/implemented \u201ccitizen budget committees\u201d.  And, to help her out, I thought I\u2019d reach out to my ICMA cohorts.  Here are my ?s:\n1) What's the citizen committee's overall mission? \n2) How did you select the citizen committee members (open it up to everyone or \u201chandpick\u201d)?\n3) Is their focus micro or macro (i.e. expense and revenue analysis at the line item or department level)? \n4) When do you bring them into the budget process; and how far into the process do they remain involved?\nThanks for the assistance and Happy New Year!\nBest regards,\nMichael Lamar\nMorgan County Manager\n\n",
