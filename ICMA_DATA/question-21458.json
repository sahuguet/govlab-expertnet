  "text": "\n\nThere is a large food manufacturing plant in our ETJ that my city have been providing free fire service to for a number of years.  It has become too expensive for the city to continue providing those services free of charge.  We are looking at a number of options for continuing to provide this service, and I am hoping that some other cities have developed innovative ways to provide and fund these services.\nThe options I have so far include:\n1)  An Emergency Service District\n2)  A Fire Service Agreement\n3)  Industrial District Agreement\n4)  Special Purpose Annexation\nI am in Texas, but I would like to hear of any ideas managers from other states (as well as Texas) might have.\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
