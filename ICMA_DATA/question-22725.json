Although primarily addressing development measures, the International Economic Development Council is a good source for performance measure ideas through their research unit.  Such measures can be adapted for broad application to an overall strategic plan.  One general thought if it is possible within the timing and planned framework for the strategic plan roll out is to engage the public primarily through several meetings in getting their buy into the measures.  During my tenure as an ACA with West Palm Beach, we heavily used community engagement as a core part of our planning efforts especially in developing performance benchmarks and it was usually a productive effort.\n\n\nSarah, you are right on target in want to stay away from \"increase\" or \"decrease\" parameters because it often times has both the community and local government become too consumed in numbers watching.

      "text": "\n\nI strongly encourage you to include outcome measures and targets. But this is likely to require you to identify measures that are not in the full control of the City--this is the very nature of outcome measures and targets. These outcome measures are likely to be influenced by other individuals and entities within the community--non-profits and the faith communities, businesses, state and federal partners.  But, by recognizing the actors that are formally outside of the government entity is the best way in which to achieve broad outcomes.  Doing so will prompt the City to develop strategies to engage these various individuals and entities--which is a critically important function of local government.  If you confine yourself to simply those activities \"under the control\" of the local government, you likely will only be measuring outputs (e.g., the number of meetings held, building permits issued) rather than the outcomes/results that matter to residents.  For a good example of community indicators, see Truckee Meadows Tomorrow (Reno/Washoe County NV).  TMT actually has individual business, non-profits and others \"adopt\" measures or targets.\n\n\nI strongly encourage you to include outcome measures and targets.

      "text": "\n\nThank you everyone for your responses. We have developed several strategies and initiatives to achieve our various goals that include partners throughout our community. Additionally, we have developed several outcome performance measures, along with efficiency measures, and some input/output ones. My main intent with the question was to determine how others have set targets for measures that the community has identified as important, but that we are very limited in our abilities to control. My concern is not that we are unable to control it, as we plan to increase and expand our partnerships with various organizations to make efforts to impact these areas, rather, that we may be setting an inappropriate or unrealistic target. For example, the percentage of residents age 18-44 with a bachelors degree or higher is an indicator that is important to our community. It is important for both the quality of life of our residents but also for attracting and retaining buisinesses by demonstrating a skilled workforce. Along this same line, the high school graduation rate is another measure that is important to our community. However, the School Board is not under our municipality and operates separately. Aside from looking at some of thier annual and strategic plans to align our goals and targets with those they have identified, we are looking for ways to set appropriate targets for ones that do not have sources to facilitate direction. We have looked at the Jacksonville experience which was helpful and are open to any other suggestions, information, or case studies. Thanks!\n\n\nThank you everyone for your responses.

That lets you understand where you really are and determine if they are the right measures of success without being committed to specific goals that may not be appropriate.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale, FL is working to finalize our first Strategic Plan! In doing so, we would like to set targets for  the community indicators we have included in the plan. Target setting for performance indicators that are within our control are much easier to set so we are looking to learn how other municipalities have approached setting targets for community indicators and thier experiences. If possible, we would like to include a target that is more concrete than \"increase\" or \"decrease.\" Thanks in advance for your assistance! \nSarah Saunders - (954)-828-5131 ssaunders@fortlauderdale.\n\n",
