  "text": "\n\nOur City Council is potentially interested in creating several standing council committees (with three members each) to address various operational categories - such as finance and budget, public safety, etc. I'm interested in your suggestions about the City STAFF  side of this issue - (1) what role do the CM and the ACM play, (2) what positions are assigned to staff each committee, who is assigned to create agendas, post notices, take notes etc. (3) what is the time commitment of staff related to each committee, assuming they meet monthly, (4) how does this change the formal council meetings, if at all?  I appreciate any advice you have based on your experiences. - Susan Thorpe, Deputy City Manager, Peoria AZ\n\n",
