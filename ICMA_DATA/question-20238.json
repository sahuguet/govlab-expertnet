      "text": "\n\nHi Danielle:\nI would like to speak to the aspect of your question regarding the use of technology in improving transparency of local government Council meetings, and have a few resources worth taking a look at (all of which have been added to the Knowledge Network, for your ease of access).\nFirst of all, there is an older article about the city of Beaverton, OR (http://icma.org/en/Article/100473/Beaverton_City_Council_Meetings_Soon_Available_Live_and_OnDemand), which describes their intentions to make webcasts of their Council meetings available to their citizens online.  They also mention the fact that they will strive to make the videos a sort of centralized launching point for finding additional resources: all videos will have a link to the document of the agenda and minutes of the meeting, but then they will add in links to both documents/evidence mentioned in the meeting, as well as additional resources worth considering within a discussion.\nSecondly, King County, WA has recently received awards for offering a very similar system to Beaverton, albeit with a few refinements.  As the article (http://icma.org/en/Article/100474/King_County_Wash_Council_Recognized_for_Webcasts_and_Online_Meetings) mentions, the county offers the same streaming video archives as many other cities, but put in the additional time necessary to bookmark each video by topic discussed \u2013 this means that a citizen interested in hearing the 5 minutes of discussion about a topic important to them can be taken directly to it by using the bookmark, rather than being forced to search an hour of video or more to find it.\nFinally, in an entirely different way, it might be worth suggesting a more active role to motivated citizens in making local government transparency a reality.  As a recent article posted on PBS explains (http://icma.org/en/Article/100472/Local_Bloggers_Step_Up_to_Watchdog_Local_Government), some citizens have taken it upon themselves to form small blogging groups, which create a simple blog and then schedule their time so they cover all Council meetings.  As a result, they can provide a sense of the content of the meeting, without the length of a video and/or textual minutes.  Additionally, the source of the commentary being a local citizen (versus a reporter or local government employee) could potentially draw addition interest from citizens who would otherwise remain uninvolved.  This might even be paired with the creation of a blog for your local government, which then links to citizen blogs on the subject of Council meetings, to encourage, foster, and enable ease of discussion.\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Danielle:\n\nI would like to speak to the aspect of your question regarding the use of technology in improving transparency of local government Council meetings, and have a few resources worth taking a look at (all of which have been added to the Knowledge Network, for your ease of access).\n\nFirst of all, there is an older article about the city of Beaverton, OR (http://icma.org/en/Article/100473/Beaverton_City_Council_Meetings_Soon_Available_Live_and_OnDemand), which describes their intentions to make webcasts of their Council meetings available to their citizens online.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Santa Monica,CA operates under a Council-management form of govenrment with seven at-large Council members representing approximately 90,000 residents.  Regular Council meetings are held on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month and generally run from 5:45 p.m. to approximately midnight, including a closed session.\nCouncil has directed staff to seek out and bring forth innovations in Council rules, policies, and/or procedures that would streamline meetings without shortchanging public dialogue or the legislative process. \nPlease share best practices, innovations, ideas, suggestions, and examples regarding time limits and approaches to public comment and councilmember discussion, frequency of meetings, agenda ordering, use of technology to communicate staff reports and other information, as well as other areas. \nStaff is also brainstorming; a report to Council is scheduled for mid-September.  Please respond to danielle.noble@smgov.net. \nThank you!\nDanielle Noble\nAssistant to the City Manager\nCity of Santa Monica\n\n",
