  "text": "\n\nWhat is the true ratio of General Fund financial support to Event Revenue/Recovered Cost for your municipally-owned performing arts facility?   As background, the City of Portsmouth has an aging 2,000 seat concert hall.  It is facing major capital improvements due to long-deferred maintenance; the public discussion of its condition has compounded the problem of declining ticket sales and show quality.  As the City considers the quality-of-life value of continuing to operate its only concert facility, I would like input from other cities on the extent to which their concert halls are self-sustaining (i.e. from admission revenue, rentals, recovered cost, etc.) versus supported by general tax revenue.\n\n",
