  "text": "\n\nIn a recent article by the Associated Press, the details of a deal between the city of Detroit, MI and the Triscuit brand of the Kraft Food Company were revealed.  Their partnership was brokered by a non-profit organization called Urban Farming, and it seeks to put low-value, blighted vacant properties back into use as valuable additions to the community.  In addition to lowering the costs of vegetables and fruits in their immediate local areas for members of that community, their produce is then easily sold to a company such as Kraft, which is helping to promote home gardens, through methods such as assisting with the creation of a website, and including free packets of dill and basil seeds in more than 40 million of the most recently-shipped boxes of Triscuits.\nIf Detroit, a city in the midst of attempting a planned contraction and consolidation of properties inwards, can manage to find the space to do this, what is stopping other local communities?  If the project involves a non-profit, an immense for-profit company, volunteers, and people doing community service, what prevents this model from working as effectively in other communities?  Check out the article here (http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j7fJcy5fXBhOPhmB7rB4AWKVkTMQD9FRDJ1G1) and try to figure out if this model could serve your local community.  Do you see any potential to improve this model?\n\n",
