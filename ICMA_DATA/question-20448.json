      "text": "\n\nHi Edwin:\nIn researching your question, I found a couple of sources of potential wisdom that may be of some assistance to you.  First of all, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has a report they compiled, of state's best practices in regulating small business, which was released in 2007.  The report is available at http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/rfa_stateguide07.pdf and has some interesting insights into the necessity of transparency and flexibility for any successful and thriving community of businesses to arise within the framework of regulations.  \nIn addition, the SBA website offers a list of links to the regulatory practices of each state government, in the event that such information would be useful for you.  You can find that list at http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/stateweb.html\nAlthough I have not seen this type of suggestion on any list of best practices, I would also suggest considering a sort of public-private partnership to encourage private businesses: in your state of Montana, for example, there is the Montana Community Development Corporation, and as their website at http://www.mtcdc.org/ describes, they seek to make loans available for businesses seeking to starting in a variety of local communities.\nIf there is a specific regulatory issue you\u2019re looking to address in your community, I might also recommend taking a look at state and federal regulations affecting Montana to see how these issues are addressed or not addressed. http://www.dli.mt.gov/resources/laws.asp#stlaws\nhttp://www.dli.mt.gov/resources/laws.asp#fedstate \nSmaller communities that are looking to spur economic development but are constantly competing with other towns and cities for businesses must strike the right balance between protecting their consumers while at the same time providing a good environment that encourages entrepreneurial interest. In that sense, relying on state and federal regulations to guide you in the development of your own regulatory construct, as well as contacting your counterparts in neighboring towns and communities to exchange ideas and ask questions, may be advisable. \nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Edwin:\n\nIn researching your question, I found a couple of sources of potential wisdom that may be of some assistance to you.
