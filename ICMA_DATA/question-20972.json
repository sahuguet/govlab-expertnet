      "text": "\n\nThe City of Philadelphia has an ethics board.  Please direct your member to www.phila.gov/ethicsboard.  There is plenty of information about what the Board does; its members; case review; etc.\nSince ICMA has a fully enforceable Code of Ethics, the ICMA Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC) reviews written allegations of unethical conduct of ICMA members.  CPC members are Vice Presidents of ICMA which means they also sit on the ICMA Executive Board.  These VPs volunteer for different Board committees and the ICMA President appoints them.  \nThe Rules of Procedure for the Enforcement of the ICMA Code of Ethics governs how the CPC reviews and determines possible sanctions.  That document, along with the ICMA Code of Ethics, is available online at http://icma.org/en/icma/ethics/enforcement.  I manage ICMA's ethics enforcement process and would be more than happy to answer any specific questions that you member has related to how ICMA enforces the Tenets of the ICMA Code of Ethics.\nHope this helps.\n\n\nThe City of Philadelphia has an ethics board.
