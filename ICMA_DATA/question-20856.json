All too often, I go onto websites and view materials written at a rudementary level with so many grammatical errors that it makes me cringe in angst. With the current state of the economy, many talented writers like myself, have been laid off by companies or local govt. offices who believe letting unqualified personnel in their IT Dept. do the writing for them at a lesser cost is an effective strategy to bring overhead costs down. It is so completely sophomoric in thought processes to think posting poorly written materials to a company's or municipality's website will ultimately save the company money. When one considers the effect of 'first impressions', I personally believe that being able to communicate with the public or potential clients in proper fashion speaks volumes and aids in maintaining a professional and profitable image.\n\n\nBeginning with #2.   \nA webmaster is a position responsible for maintaining the IT (software)aspects of a Web page and is capable of properly adding information to the page which is well written by others.

      "text": "\n\nI agree with Jessica's comments. Especially the piece about the need for web publishers increasing -- someone who knows how to properly create & present content -- not just how to code a webpage.\nI'd worry less about what you call the positions, and more about what type of help you actually need. Maybe two well rounded people that can play multiple roles? Or maybe someone with strong content skills teamed with someone with more technical skills that work closely as a team? If you want to attract more content and strategy focused type people possible titles could be web publisher, web content manager, web manager, web producer, web specialist. More technical? You might want to try web developer if you are looking for someone that can develop code. Most importantly, you'll want to be specific about what kind of code and systems you want this person to know.\nIn regard to the web publisher, I think you need someone with more than just writing skills -- though being able to write clearly and concisely with a web user in mind is essential. The person should also understand how web users read a webpage (it's not a linear reading experience where you turn a page to get more content). In addition, the publisher should know how to format and contextually include images and video in the content of a webpage and have some comfort with HTML and embedding third party code so that you can bring in feeds, etc. A communications background can also help when you think about promoting your web content. If nobody knows you have a great piece on recycling programs in your community, how will they find it to read? You must promote. And that's where some photoshop & graphic design skills also come in handy for creating web ads. Experience with search engine optimization (SEO - to help people find your content) and web analytics tools (to see what works) are bonuses.\nWithout knowing more about your technology set-up, it's hard to say what you may or may not need in a technical role.Regardless of who you get, I think it's essential that these two people develop a strong working relationship. They'll be very effective if they can work in tandem on projects.\n\n\nI agree with Jessica's comments.
