      "text": "\n\nDavid,\nMiami County utilizes fixed forward contracts for its fuel supply to help stablize and predict the amount of money spent for fuel.  We typically contract with 3, 6 and/or 12 month contracts for fuel.  As a rule, we contract up to 50 percent of our annual usage and ride out the market for the other 50 percent.  The philosophy is similar to dollar cost averaging via regular payments into a retirement account.  The fuel market is not predictible but by contracting you can level out the ups and downs by monitoring and buying contracts during low periods.  Touch base with your local fuel suppliers and determine what they offer.  Expect to pay about 20-26 cents premium over the current rack price.\n\n\nDavid,\nMiami County utilizes fixed forward contracts for its fuel supply to help stablize and predict the amount of money spent for fuel.

      "text": "\n\nIn recent years the cost of fuel has ranged from slightly over $2 per gallon to the $4 range. The extreme volatility and variance playing out in the fuel markets has made it virtually impossible for Fleet Managers in cities, counties, special districts, and public safety entities to anticipate future expenditures when preparing their annual fuel budgets. As a result, large and sometimes repeated budget amendments often become necessary to request additional funding to cover increased fuel expenditures. This is never a pleasant experience for those of us in such a predicament. Exposure to extreme price hikes can place a fuel budget in jeopardy and ultimately threaten the delivery of core services beyond your own department or division. As a result, there is an undeniable need to ensure that the delivery of services is not jeopardized. Predicting such outcomes, even when tracking the leading economic indicators is getting tougher and tougher and is certainly less reliable.\nBeginning in January 2009, the City of Palm Bay instituted an Energy Price Risk Management Strategy (EPRMS). This process is designed to minimize the fuel budget's exposure to volatile fuel markets, thus adding certainty to a pre-determined volume of fuel in the future. In the past, during times of rising fuel prices, expenditures have been managed through a reduction in consumption. In other words, use less = pay less.  Everyone has implemented their conservation plans, no-idle policies, purchase of smaller vehicles, use of hybrids and alternative fuels, but I am sure you hear all the complaints from users about the impact to their operations of such initiatives.\nThe EPRMS adopted by the City of Palm Bay utilizes financial hedges that increase and decrease in value based on movement of the fuel markets, and without any impacts to the operation and the departments we serve. Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a futures contract. As prices spike, capital gains from the sale of these contracts compensate the fuel budget to cover the increased costs incurred while purchasing fuel.  Conversely, when prices decrease, the contract is sold at a loss, but a decline in fuel expenditures compensates for that loss. This has worked well for us in Palm Bay. In FY2010 alone yielding close to double digit percentage realized gains as well as adding certainty to its fuel budget. In FY2009 alone, hedging resulted in net gains totaling over $74,000, or roughly\n8.2% to the fuel budget, thus compensating the budget for higher than expected expenditures, and greater yields realized than any of the other initiatives employed.\nPrior to any government agency establishing an EPRMS, there may be legal issues which may need to be addressed. Changing existing ordinances and/or investment policies may become necessary to allow for entering into investments of nontraditional securities using public funds.\nMembers of governing bodies, policy-makers, appointed and elected officials may also be unfamiliar with hedging instruments, so a review of the principles behind the concept may become necessary to sell these individuals on the merits of such a strategy.\nWhen the strategy is finally put into motion it is imperative that results are closely tracked and reported on a periodic basis. We have employed the services of a financial planning firm to manage our transactions as well as the tracking thereof. Reporting is done weekly but, keep in mind that the month to month gains and losses should not be the primary focus, but rather the emphasis should be placed on the long term stability in the fuel budget that is derived from the strategy, much like any successful investment strategy.\nThere also exists the opportunity for multiple government units to pool resources in order to gain economies of scale, that result from sharing administrative costs and purchasing futures contracts in larger quantities and with greater frequency.  This may require entering into multi-jurisdictional inter-local agreements.\nThe benefit of increased certainty in the fuel budget extends beyond the fleet budgets too. Since we are now able to more accurately predict our yearly fuel expenditures, reserve funds being held in anticipation of extreme fuel price hikes are no longer needed. This alone frees up big dollars for other city-wide and community priorities.\nJim Proce, Public Works Director, City of Palm Bay, Florida\n\n\nIn recent years the cost of fuel has ranged from slightly over $2 per gallon to the $4 range.

I am particularly worried about fuel costs escalating during a budget year that would require a though reduction in service delivery to accommodate (i.e., from $3.00 per gal to $5.00 or more). \nThanks.\n\n",
