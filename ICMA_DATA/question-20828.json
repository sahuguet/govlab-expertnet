Please see my response, as it contains links to documents and pages that I believe will also apply to your questions. There are many reports, articles and studies to be found within these links that attempt to outline standards and practices for municipal blogging.\nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/kn/Question/20617/Internal_debate__departments_facebook_or_centralized\nThis question deals with the question of whether a city ought to have multiple Facebook pages (i.e. a Mayor's office page, A Parks and Rec page, a Police Dept. page, a Public Works page, etc) or one centralized page that ensures the city speaks with one voice. I think since you're asking specifically about creating a Parks and Rec page, that the responses to this question will give you an idea of how other municipalities handle it. \nIf you're looking for justifications to use Facebook and other social media tools, the documents section of our Social Media Topic Page is a great place to find well-researched data on how and why local governments are using social media to reach audiences and demographics that they never had access to before. Most of the documents on the first page will have some application to your question. \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/281/Social_Media#Tab=Documents\nI hope this helps to get you started. Good luck. \nDerek Johnson\n\n\nHi Tabitha,\n\nThere are a couple of questions previously posted on the Knowledge Network that I think might be useful to you.\n\nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/kn/Question/20686/Interoffice_Blog\n\nThis question was about starting an interoffice blog.

      "text": "\n\nTabitha,\nOne thing I'd recommend doing is stepping back and identifying where your existing communications gaps are, and what your communications goals are.  Too frequently, folks get tied up in using specific tools -- we hop on the bandwagon, for better or (more likely) for worse (i.e. \"everyone\" else is Tweeting, so we should too).  It's better to take a holistic approach to your communications initiatives.  What I've found is that many of the \"new\" tools available do little to reach new customers.  Social media is based on existing social connections... if people like you now and consume your information now, they will likely become your fan.  This does little to reach new audiences; rather, it improves the chance of existing customers actually reading your information.\nI recommend developing performance measures for all of your marketing efforts -- who do you want to reach and how effective/efficient are you at reaching them? What's the conversion rate?  What is your return on investment?  How does one tool compare to another when trying to reach specific populations?  Is there one tool that you can use to reach everyone?  When it comes to social media, everyone thinks it's easy to implement.  It is.  However, it's not so easy to implement correctly.\nSpecific to Facebook, the effectiveness will be based entirely on how much effort you put into creating quality posts.  You have to decide how much time you want to dedicate to maintaining the site, reaching new audiences, and facilitating communication between the department and your customers.\nFeel free to email me at cwalker@bellevuewa.gov if you'd like to chat more about this -- I've done some extensive research on the topic.\n\n\nTabitha,\n\nOne thing I'd recommend doing is stepping back and identifying where your existing communications gaps are, and what your communications goals are.

I need to justify the usage of Facebook though.\nIf you are currently using Facebook, could you tell me if it is beneficial?  What type of increase in participation / registration you seen as a result of posting on Facebook?  Any issues (virius, etc)?  Any other suggestions / comments that would be helpful.\nThank you for your help!\nTabitha Riley\n\n",
