  "text": "\n\nThe City of Redondo Beach, CA is moving its Recreation and Community Services Department from a 12,000 square foot campus to a 6,000 sq. foot modular structure.  They have a very paper-intensive group of services (including federally funded housing assistance, etc.)  and storage has become a real problem.     They are looking for filing and storage systems that can help maximize the space - e.g. floor to ceiling moving systems, as opposed to four foot metal cabinets, etc.   \nIf you can suggest storage solutions, Vendors or any relative information, please forward ASAP.  \nThank you!  \nPamela Muse  \nWestern Regional Director  \nAlliance for Innovation  \n888-468-6450  \npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
