  "text": "\n\nThe City of Eustis Florida has a trademarked marketing brand logo. We have 3 local business vendors who are authorized to prepare items at the request of the City for specific uses such as employee shirts, hats, etc. However, during the past few months, we have had requests from several residents and visitors that would like to purchase items with our brand on it to show their pride and to give as gifts or souvenirs.\nThe City of Eustis Florida has a trademarked marketing brand logo. We have 3 local business vendors who are authorized to prepare items at the request of the City for specific uses such as employee shirts, hats, etc. However, during the past few months, we have had requests from several residents and visitors that would like to purchase items with our brand on it to show their pride and to give as gifts or souvenirs.\nWith that in mind, we are considering an online store through the City\u2019s website that would offer a limited amount of approved items for public purchase, or possibly contracting with several local merchants as authorized sellers, as well as our Chamber of Commerce and historical museum. This would not be so much as a profit venture as we would only make a percentage of the product cost, but rather a brand awareness campaign.\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? I would love to see examples, if any, of where this was actually done!\n\n",
