However, I discourage some City of Aspen Departments from having their own page and ask them to contribute information to the central City page instead. (No one wants to follow the Parking Dept. on FB, but for other departments, it makes sense for them to have a public presence in this medium.) My rule of thumb: if you don't have something interesting to post for the public each day, you shouldn't be on Facebook with your own page.\n\n\nI would suggest having a separate page for your police no matter what.

We have 2,278 fans right now and it seems that maintaining one FB page is a sufficient commitment of Village resources without expanding it to to or more pages that require regular postings and associated monitoring. As for OPPD, they provide updates via their webpage and other communication tools.\nWe love our FB page and fans!
