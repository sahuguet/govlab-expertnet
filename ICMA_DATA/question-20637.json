  "text": "\n\nHave any cities had experience with creating a relationship with a banking entity to offer a credit card where a portion of the proceeds go to support the city or a city program?  I have found a great deal of data on College and University affinity card programs, but have found very little information on cities that have tried it or sustained it.  This could have been an innovative enhanced revenue program or an economic development initiative to improve commerce for your city.  Any information on this topic for local government would be helpful.\n\n",
