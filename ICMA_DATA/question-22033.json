  "text": "\n\nThe typical metrics used to predict future economic growth or decline in the US seems to be construction and manufacturing. I'm sure there are others as well. These measures are good for the US as a whole and also only help predict a couple of months into the future.\nWe are starting to think about 3 year forecasts and are trying to determine what might be good indicators of the local economy for short term, 1 year, and 2 years out. Does anyone currently have a list of metrics that you use to predict short term and long term growth or contraction in your County/City/Region?\nI'm looking for ideas right now, and I know every location might be different due to the economic base in your area, but it might help get me started. It would also help if you have examples of information that's easy to obtain.\nAnything helps.\nThanks,\nAlan Rosen\nBudget Manager, Washoe County, NV\n\n",
