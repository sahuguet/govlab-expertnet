Meaningful performance metrics (i.e. measuring the correct benchmarks to ensure that services improve not just statistically but holistically) \n2.) Genuine engagement and training of lower and street-level staff in order to communicate the importance and relevance of any newly implemented performance measurement system. It's not enough that management thinks it's a good idea, the men and women responsible for the data collection must also believe it will have a positive impact on delivery of services.  \n3.) There must be a smart public marketing campaign to advertise the purpose of and philosophy behind the new system, so that the public understands why the changes are being made, what new benefits they should expect and how to provide the proper feedback on the metrics being used.  \nHow well do you believe the VDOT system addresses these concerns?\n\n\nAlex, \n\nFor me, any effective performance measurement system must have the following three features: \n\n1.)

      "text": "\n\nThanks for sharing the VDOT example, Alexander.  It's definitely a handsome dashboard, and it seems the measures are pretty solid.  I think one of the glaring issues,  however, is the lack of relevant context - especially historical data.  Are they improving, maintaining, or getting worse?  Is the number of highway deaths an improvement from the previous year?  Gauges are nice to look at, but they can be overly simple too.  I think the gauge works well for the budget variance, but I'm not sure about the others.  Sometimes a good old bar chart will do the trick, and allow you to include historical data.  I do, however, think that it's worth the effort to make something that looks good, even if it loses a little bit of its precision.  What good is a bland tabulation of data if nobody wants to look at it?  Again, thanks for sharing!\nTom\n\n\nThanks for sharing the VDOT example, Alexander.

I think these are extreemly helpful for the public and elected officials, especially when there is a \"drill down\" feature that allows one to see the measures behind the measures. The more detailed the measure, the more helpful they are for managers on the ground to decide how best to use that information for positive change. \nI don't advocate for one software over another, and I've never actually used Active Strategy, it just happens to be the coolest one I've seen for dashboards and performance measurement tracking.

One of the most creative dashboard reports I've come across is the Virginia Department of Transportation performance reporting system.  Their data visualization technique makes crucial performance measurement results easy to understand and absorb by using a view that is commonly understood.\nhttp://dashboard.virginiadot.org/\nDoes your jurisdiction do anything similar to help make complex information accessible to your citizens?\n\n",
