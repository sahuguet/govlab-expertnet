  "text": "\n\nI am interested in hearing about any ordinances that are in effect that regulate residential wind turbines in your communities.

Because there is very little potential for any type of large scale wind turbines to be erected in the community, the focus is primarily on potential residential wind turbines. As it is a major safety issue,  I am particularly interested in learning more about setback requirements for residential turbines.\n\n",
