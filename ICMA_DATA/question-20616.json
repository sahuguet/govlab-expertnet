It was based on the entry level of the lowest paid position.  Say we gave a 3% on base salary and that resulted in a $1.00 raise.  Each range down the table was adjusted $1.00.  As a result the salary adjustment as you moved down the ranges, the percentage increase became lower than 3%.  That kept the higher paid positions from growing too much.  Those, like me, in the higher paid ranges didn't like it much.  For newer employees in those higher ranges, it was tough to understand because they thought they were getting the 3%.  It ended up the increase was about 1%+ at the higher levels.\nI think this was designed by a guy that wanted to punish innovation and risk through the pay plan.  I think it achieved its objective.\n\n\nIn one of the communities I worked,we dealt with compression my putting a fixed amount on each range in the pay table.

  "text": "\n\nWe are discussing a compensation issue which deals with compression. One of our options is to hold employees at their current pay level (in a step system) so there is no movement in 2011 and continue in 2012 on our regular schedule. One of the consequences when we resume with the normal step movements is compression. \nAny ideas how to limit compression?\n\n",
