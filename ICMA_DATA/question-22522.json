Our other ways of checking are: 1) if you step on a field and water comes up in your steps it's out of play. The soil might be hard but with that water and the cleats tearing into the ground it will create mud which cause damage to a field. 2) Another way is if you step on a field and you are leaving more then a half inch deep foot print fields are out of play. \nThe biggest problem is holding the teams to all this. Users feel that they paid for it (reservation fees) and they have right to play on the field. We do have a rain out number for teams to call, so if we take a field out of play and they go ahead and play on it anyway, we can hold them to damages. That alone is still a task. We can never check every field in the city everyday and by time you see what happened it is too late. And there will have been different users, so there is no true way of figuring out who is responsible. We expect our users to be responsible for checking sport fields before they play.\non behalf of \nShawn Lindsey\nLead /athletic field services\n\n\nI can answer on the sports field side of things.

All user groups want to play, but allowing them on after a wet spring or heavy rains can cause damage that takes an entire growing season to repair. Soil conditions vary by region, so you'll need to craft your own guidelines. However, even with guidelines, you need to give your staff support to close fields when conditions merit the closure.\n\n\nCities invest thousands into athletic fields.
