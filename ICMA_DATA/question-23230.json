It's a little different form of economic development, as it is designed to keep money within the community, though it also creates construction jobs, and I have attached a document that explains it a little further.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to talk with you about it, just contact me a dthurnau@theadmincenter.com.\n\n\nHello Marcos,\nThough I don't have any resources specific to your question,  I did want to make you aware that our company, Community Green Energy, is currently looking to work with cities to develop community solar projects, especially in Ohio.

You might want to check out the International Economic Development Council website because it does have a focus on trends in \"green\" oriented development.  Also, many traditional economic development program tool boxes are now including green energy/sustainability companies as a focus for traditional incentive packages.\n\n\nMarcos, I'm a little to the dance on this question but it is a good one.
