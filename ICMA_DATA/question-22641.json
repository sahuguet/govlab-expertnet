  "text": "\n\nI have a member that is reviewing all employee benefits and trying to get everyone on the same page. In the union contracts the employees get longevity pay, hazardous duty pay, uniform allowances, flex spending account funds, etc.  but non-rep employees do not.  It makes payroll complicated when each employee group gets something a little different. \nTo make it more uniform and to reduce expenses they are looking at giving employees one smaller sum that they could then choose to put toward flex spending, clothing or maybe retirement. They are trying to think what the fund could we called, how to manage it, and what the right amount would be. \nHas anyone done anything similar to this?   Any information would be helpful.\n\n",
