  "text": "\n\nThe City of Santa Monica operates under a Council-management form of government with seven at-large Council members representing approximately 90,000 residents.  Regular Council meetings are held on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month and generally run from 5:45 p.m. to approximately midnight, including a closed session.\nCouncil has directed staff to seek out and bring forth innovations in Council rules, policies, and/or procedures that would streamline meetings without shortchanging public dialogue or the legislative process. \nPlease share best practices, innovations, ideas, suggestions, and examples regarding time limits and approaches to public comment and councilmember discussion, frequency of meetings, agenda ordering, use of technology to communicate staff reports and other information, as well as other areas. \nThanks!\nDanielle\n\n",
