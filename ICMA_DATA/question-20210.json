It is at the top of the list for expenditure priorities for our City so the fund is NOT raided or unfunded to balance the budget. Contact Kirk Bednar, Asst.

In years when no heavy (read: expensive) equipment is being purchased the fund balance will swell, making it look like a bull\u2019s-eye for budget cuts (see Michael's comments).\nSo it is vital that council and city management understand that cutting it in the short-run will lead to deficits in the long-run (a problem compounded if growth in vehicle prices exceeds typical inflation growth).\nThe replacement cycle for our solid waste trucks is eight years.  Although, based on recent analysis, we are considering whether or not to shorten it to seven or even six years.  Not sure about the replacement cycle for fire trucks, but you can contact Sheldon Belyeu or Jamie Goldspink at 210.207.8380 (Fleet Acquisitions) for details.\n\n\nOur system works similar to Michael's although I will say that unless your fleet is very well balanced (same number of vehicles from each class being replaced each year) the balance of the fund can fluctuate significantly.

The matrix uses monthly mileage calculations based on the anticipated replacement criteria, and assesses a depreciation payment. ie. if a vehicle is utilized more heavily than another the depreciation for the heavily used vehicle will be more than a similar vehicle with less use.  We then add on the mileage rate that covers repair, maintenance, and fuel.  This allows us to recover all of our costs for the particular vehicle.  See the following URL for the matrix layout.\nhttp://fleet.utah.gov/administration/fleetfinance/documents/2010RateMatrixforpublicFinalFinal5-13-10.pdf\n\n\nThe State of Utah utilizes a rate matrix to calculate the appropriate lease rate.

First, we usually have an annual \"operating futures\" budget where at the end of the year, we transfer the set-aside into designated general fund balance for minor capital outlays such as fleet, IT or special projects - basically we bank or escrow money into the succeding year(s). Second, in our major capital outlays fund which comes largely from sales tax, we often apply a charge for internal construction projects (like roads or other bricks and mortar stuff), or external projects (if the school system needs site work for a construction project at a lower rate than provided by a private contractor). We pay back the general fund for labor, and place equipment charges based on FEMA hourly rate schedules into a sub-account in the Major CO Fund to help replenish funds we expend for leasing the heavy equipment we use.\n\n\nBulloch County, GA does it two ways.
