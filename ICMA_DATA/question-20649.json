I used a firm in California called Jobs Available (http://www.jobsavailable.net/) to find a number of jobs early in my career. Subscribe, it will be worth the expense.  The next thing you should do is complete your online ICMA profile.  We have no idea about where you went to school, what part of the country you live in, where you want to work (my advice there is \"anywhere you can find work).  If you have had an internship in college, exploit the experience.  If you didn't have an internship, go visit a nearby community and volunteer for a project.  If your state association has memberships for students, ask for a membership waiver (never hurts to ask).  Learn who the managers are in your area and visit with them.  With the internship concept you need to rememember you are selling and the managers are buying.  Find out what they need and be the answer to that need.  After you see someone, write (hand write) a thank you note.  Folks don't do that much but it is impressive when they do. You want to be impressive!  I would be glad to speak to you about where you are headed.  I never worked in a CM's office until I was one but all my experiences made that transition easier.  This period of time will be tough because you don't have a job but you have an advantage the May/June graduated don't have--you are available now.  You said that was a problem.  I see it as a great opportunity (I have always been an optimist).\nWhen some jobs say they want 5 years of experience, you can get in the door with \"relevant\" experience.\nThe one thing I look for when hiring is \"attitude.\"  I would take a 2.5 GPA BA candidate with a good attitude over a 4.0 GPA BA with a poor attitude any day.\nIf you want to talk about your career goals, click on my name and get the email address or phone number.\n\n\nAsk your professors to give you some leads.

I have an MPA and I'm approaching two years of local government experience (and loving it). \nI've found it difficult to get an interview thus far, probably for a number of reasons (e.g. lack of experience, high unemployment, etc.).  I got an opportunity to interview here with the City of San Antonio (where I work as a Sr. Management Analyst) through an alumni contact, an avenue you might want to explore.  Having an \"in\" with someone won't get you a job if you don't have the skills/experience, but can be very helpful in getting an interview. \nUltimately, I agree with most of the folks here, don't be too picky about your first position.  Get your foot in the door, have a good attitude, and let your skills shine as you gain valuable experience.  Spend the time wisely networking with others in local government by posting (like you've done here) and volunteering for projects outside your specific scope of work.  I think if you do this opportunities will open up for you (it's worked for me so far). \nGood luck to you, whatever you decide!\n\n\nNatalie, \n\nWhile I'm not fully engaged in a search for an assistant position, I have applied for a few.

He's currently the youngest employee on staff. So it is possible.\nAs a young person, myself, who one day is looking at entering the City Management profession, I would recommend that you ask yourself the following question: Am I prepared to serve in a leadership position where thousands of residents rely on me?\nFor me, the answer is: not yet. I even have a Master's and 5+ yrs of govt work, but there is still so much I have to learn (yes, in lower level positions) before I'll be truly ready for that type of a position.\n\n\nNatalie, sorry, but it's going to be VERY difficult to secure an Assistant position without significant experience/a MPA. \n\nHowever, it's not impossible.
