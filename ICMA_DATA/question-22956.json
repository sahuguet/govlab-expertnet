Many Departments have their personnel conduct company level inspections such as smoke/carbon monoxide detector inspections, propane and oil burner inspections.  Many Departments are also doing building tours/preplans to enter into a mobile data system to better prepare when called to those addresses.  Equipment upkeep and maintenance are a vital component to a productive and professional fire department.  Items such as hose testing, pump testing, self contained breathing apparatus maintenance and ground ladder testing are all items needed to be tested on an annual basis as outlined in National Fire standards.  Finally...training.  Personnel need to remain competent in all of their skills in order to perform at the highest level.  Everyday, these personnel should be conducting some level of training to maintain their proficiencies.  Firefighters no longer just fight fires.  They are asked to respond to all hazards emergencies.  This requires much more training and preparation to meet the needs of the communities.  This is just a quick snapshot of some other activities as there are many more ancillary activities that are completed by these individuals on a regular basis.  Hope this helps as a starting point.\n\n\nThere are many activities and functions that fire personnel are responsible for in addition to just responding to emergencies.

      "text": "\n\nI think you have a multi-tiered answer to this problem.  First, it sounds from your question that the fire department DOES do emergency medical response, but it simply doesn't transport patients.  I can't overemphasize the need for fire departments to become more and more involved in EMS.  If your agency can, it should look at ways to further embrace this service delivery model in the future.  In addition to that , I think the problem needs to be quantified.  How much \"downtime\" do they have and what does this this definition include?  If they're working out in the station is this perceived as downtime?  Remember that we want firefighters to have some amount of downtime.  Their availability when emergency calls do occur is essential to the entire idea of public safety.  If we preoccupy them to much we'll find them unavailable or ill-position/prepared to respond.  In my city, we measure downtime in terms of reliability.  We want all of our units to be available 90% of the time to ensure we can meet national consensus standards (namely NFPA 1710).  Certainly that availability can be utilized to the benefit of the municipality.  \nGood managers and supervisors, when given the support by administration to do their jobs, will keep their crews busy in a productive manner.  The best departments have their fire crews out doing low-hazard inspections (often called \"company-level inspections\"), flowing and inspecting fire hydrants a few times a year, attending formal training courses during the workweek, conducting company-level training at their leisure, assisting with public education, maintaining equipment/apparatus/facilities, etc.\nThe two best and most unique programs I've seen are the minimum company standards (MCS) training program and smoke detector saturation program.  The MCS training program places some training requirements on the station officer to conduct on a quarterly basis.  This allows them to set the schedule and interface with other stations to conduct some \"grassroots\" training in addition to other training programs offered by our training division.  It is not uncommon in our city to find some parking lots occupied by fire trucks on a Sunday afternoon getting their MCS training done.  Even more important is that this training, when married to a good department-wide formal training program, has improved our performance on the emergency incident scene (lower fire loss, injury rates, and overall anecdotal success).  \nThe smoke detector saturation program was an add-on to our policy of installing smoke detectors at the request of citizens.  Now we saturate neighborhoods with multiple fire trucks to install detectors after any significant structure fire occurs.  Again, this program is managed at the lowest level possible and creates opportunities for the men and women of the fire department to be in the public eye while making a huge difference in safety.\nThe policies are attached.  I hope this helps some.\n\n\nI think you have a multi-tiered answer to this problem.

Our firefighters do ride in to the hospital on about 2.5K incidents a year but we do have some down time, especially in the southern portion of our city due to the rural population density in that area.\nOur Firefighters work 24 hours and they are required to do 1 hour minimum of physical training, 1 hour minimum of practical or classroom (in station) training.  We do daily basic facility maintenance as well as scheduled quarterly inspections and maintenance (cleaning, appliances, windows, floor wax, etc.).  We handle daily apparatus check-off and we have weekly and monthly apparatus duties under the direction of the City Garage.  We also do hydrant maintenance throughout the year (paint and flush, communicate with public utilities on work orders).  We complete pre plans and site visits of both major and minor target hazards in our first due areas.  Major targets are hospital, education facilities, assembly, special hazards... Minor targets are condos/apartments, strip malls, stand alone businesses...  \nWe provide car seat installations, smoke detector installations and Smoke and CO detector checks (on calls and by appointment).  We provide station tours, walk in or by appointment (groups and individuals).  We assist with the Project Life Saver program to change the batteries on wristbands for Alzheimer's and autistic citizens.  We assist our fire education staff with school demonstrations, preschool and 4th grade program.  We do any required paperwork (fire reports, program reports, activity reporting, daily logs, drill reports).  Beyond our daily training requirement our Battalion officers do proficiency testing on a quarterly basis and we do department wide full in service training twice a year.  We also do specialty training: 2 per year for Ladder Companies, 4 for our Heavy Squads to train together (2 Haz Mat focused and 2 tech rescue focused) plus 2 each in their own focus area alone for a total of 10, 6-8 hour training days per month).  We train as needed with our community partners, mutual and auto aid, military installations and public safety partners.  We are also responsible for emergency management for the city to we include on duty staff in planning and activities for exercises both table top and full scale.  We attend community meetings as available (civic leagues, community action councils).    \nLast we empower and involve line staff in projects for the department and allow work to be completed on duty.  Examples of teams Operational Planning Team, research and evaluate new tools and tactics, develop training and advise leadership on future considerations for the department, SOP workgroup collect feedback and complete rewrites of SOPs also ensure SOPs are free of conflicting information or outdated language, Q/A group, review and perform Q/A on fire reports communicate with public safety analysts on data and train department on report writing and quality improvement.  We also allow members to work on special projects that will help the city, for example we had an officer recently ask to work with GIS to update the Fire Department Connection data in our city map system.  The department supports all of these things and they are performed on duty.  \nIf you have any other questions, please contact Amy Valdez, \nBattalion Chief, Virginia Beach Fire Department\navaldez@vbgovcom  757-385-1075, 757-377-0134\n\n\nIn Virginia Beach we do provide EMS care but our transport services are provided by another department.

I assume there are some progressive fire departments that perform some services, whether internal or external, while waiting for calls for service.\nThe Abilene Fire Department does not provide EMS services, so there can be lots of down time where firefighters are waiting for a call. Most calls are medical calls and don't require our firefighters to stay on-site. \nI am interested in ways that cities use firefighters while on duty.\nThanks.\n\n",
