  "text": "\n\nLast weekend, we had our first snow of the season here in DC!  With winter rapidly approaching, many jurisdictions will soon be engaging in snow and ice control efforts. In one of our recent analytics memos, which are distributed to city managers whose jurisdictions participate in the Center for Performance Measurement, we reported that there is a strong correlation between snow and ice control efforts and citizen satisfaction levels.  In fact, in 2010, CPM wrote a case study on the Town of Fishers's consolidated snow removal services, a change they made in the face of a $300,000 revenue shortfall and citizen satisfaction ratings that were below their desired levels.  That case study can be found here:  http://icma.org/Documents/QuestionAnswer/Document/6941\nDoes your jurisdiction measure citizen satisfaction ratings for snow and ice control efforts, and if so, what changes have you made in recent years to improve satisfaction levels?\n\n",
