      "text": "\n\nFirefighter employment testing is a particularly sensitive area, currently subject to numerous lawsuits throughout the country. Although the Supreme Court ruled on the Ricci case in New Haven it left open numerous questions on firefighter testing that are now working their way through the lower courts. \nTo begin with, what physical testing are you doing? Has the test been validated? This is especially important since physical testing often produces disparate results and these can be challenged. This places the city in the position where it will need to prove the validity of the tests. If you are using a locally developed test it would be better to think about the use of a nationally recognized, validated test such as the CPAT (Candidate Physical Ability Test) used throughout the country. Using this test requires specific equipment and trained testers \u2013 all part of the important validation process. \nOnce you have identified the test to use, do you provide for a \u201cpractice\u201d session to insure that all candidates are familiar with the test before taking it? If not, and some candidates have had access to the test (perhaps through a friend or relative on the department) you are again exposed to potential litigation. \nWhat exactly constitutes the scoring system? Is the physical test a pass / fail or does the candidate get a score? If scored, is it combined with the written exam score to produce a final score? Combining scores is sometimes used to address the disparate results that can be created by pass / fail. \nWhat exactly constitutes the oral board? Is it a structured interview process with scoring? If scored, is that added into the final score to create a list or is it simply pass / fail. Are the questions relevant and valid and defensible? \nIf you give a physical exam (which of course you should) it can only be required after a \u201cconditional offer of employment\u201d is made. Same thing is true of a psychological examination. I am constantly amazed at how few departments do psychological testing for firefighter / paramedics. It what can be a very high stressed job, clearly this should be done. \nFinally what about background exams? I often see cities that do excellent background exams on police applicants but none on firefighters. Yet, firefighters have access to people\u2019s homes routinely. \nIn summary, this is tricky stuff and you should consult an attorney familiar with testing law before beginning any testing process.\n\n\nFirefighter employment testing is a particularly sensitive area, currently subject to numerous lawsuits throughout the country.

  "text": "\n\nI'm researching to see what screening and selection techniques other municipalities are using for the Firefighter Hiring Process. What are your techniques and criteria for selecting an applicant to move forward in the hiring process? For example, if you have over 600 applications  and 10 openings, do you invite all 600 to to test for the position or not. If not, what is your screening technique used at this initial phase and through out.  Also, what is your design for establishing a pool of applicants to choose from when you have other position to fill later? For example, do you rank your pool candidates based on scoring or are they placed on an elibility list. Any and all information or thoughts is greatly appreciated.\n\n",
