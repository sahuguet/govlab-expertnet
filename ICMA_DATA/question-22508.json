There are also a number of posts on this topic through Govloop. I could send you a copy of our policy, which took a couple years to develop, but my biggest piece of advice is to just jump in. Social media is not particular amenable to the traditional government mindset of study, analyze, adopt, implement. If you do that, by the time you develop a Facebook-specific protocol, the world will have moved on to some other platform. We had a number of departments that already had accounts before we finalized our policy; I'd be surprised if you don't find the same is true for your organization.\n\n\nThe Institute for Local Government in California has some do's and don'ts for social media.

It allows for some limited two-way communication but only if it is brief and encourages the user to contact the Village in some other manner.  This is our second policy (our first allowed no two-way communication).  I think you'll find that regardless of what any policy says, you have to accept two-way communication will happen, and it's best to address it up front.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance or if you have any questions.\n\n\nDavid: \n\nThe Village of Gurnee (IL) adopted this Unified Communications policy earlier this year, which is inclusive of all commuications but does cover social media specifically.

  "text": "\n\nBefore our Township launches itself into the cyberspace jungle that is social networking, we are looking to create a well-constructed policy that will guide our campaign.  It is my hope that the policy will allow for two-way communication between the Township and our residents, as well as help us access the \"young professional\" demographic that we have traditionally struggled with engaging.  I am looking for advice on how to launch this endeavor, what to be careful of, and general 'best practices' that can help to ensure social media success.  Any thoughts?\n\n",
