  "text": "\n\nWe are looking to explore the development of an Enterprise Risk Management system for the city.  However, we are in early days with respect to our current risk management framework and policy...which prescribes a project based process and tool for evaluation and guidance on the development of project risk registers.\nYet, this still puts us a long way from the going down the path of an ERM system.  What I would like to do is hear from others who may also be undertaking similar in-roads toward understanding how holistic risk management influences operations within your organization (beyond insurance, liability etc) and the strategy and processes being pursued (i.e. education/training, top-down v bottom-up etc) to help institutionalize it.\nAlso, is anyone aware of any municipalities who have excelled in this area?\nCheers, \nRick\n\n",
