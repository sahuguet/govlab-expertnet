Frankly, little has changed from when the report was written other than police and fire departments have gotten much more expensive. The down time in fire departments continues to be significant. \nThe Broward County, Florida Sheriff operates the county fire department but there is no cross training. Citrus County, Florida is considering having the sheriff take over the fire department and there has been some talk about cross training but no decisions have been made yet. Sheriff\u2019s Departments in Michigan and elsewhere provide EMS services.\nCities are increasingly looking to the public safety concept to address the serious financial difficulties they will be facing long term. ICMA Center for Public Safety Management is working with several cities helping them to create public safety departments. We recently hosted a delegation from Sweden that wanted to learn more about the concept and how it could be implemented there. We arranged visits with 5 cities in Michigan operating under the system.\n\n\nAs the co-author of the MIS Report (attached) with Dr. Kenneth Chelst, I can honestly tell you that although it was written in 1991 it is still the most definitive work on the subject.

Like with a car: a bad car, dirty, can be use both for potatoes and children...\nIf you think a policeman can do the work of a firefighter, I encourage you to check the level of knowledge of both because if you imagine the merging, this can be only because of the low level of them. Do you imagine merging the doctor activity with the postman one?\nThe real question is to know if you want to budget number of people or quality of job.\nBecause even if you cut the budget, mix FF and policeman, if the only thing these guys can do in front of my house in fire, is destroying it and transforming it in swimming pool, next time I will not vote for you.\nBest regards\nPierre-Louis\nPS: I'm instructor of firefighters instructors, on structural firefighting activity\n\n\nHi,\n\nFrom a European point of view (so sorry for my poor english), I think the merging is a good idea if you have FF with a poor level, and sherif office with a poor level.

However, these reports are 35 and 20 years old respectfully.\nWould there be any younger documents available that discuss the pros and cons of such a merger?  Also any research available on merging fire AND EMS with a SHERIFF office?\nAny and all conversations/documents/references that could be provided would be very helpful.\nTHANKS\n\n",
