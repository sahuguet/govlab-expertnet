  "text": "\n\nOur organization provides numerous examples of employment agreements but none that I found for separation agreements.  Separation Agreements are equally important and in some cases more important than the Employment Agreement.  Being forced to resign or being fired is distressing and painful for managers.  I think it is beneficial to provide guidance on this matter as well, especially given that in most cases this transition period is often emotionally devastating and isolating.  I know that in my own recent experience it would have helped a great deal.  Could we as an organization provide samples for managers going through this period?\n\n",
