  "text": "\n\nFerndale has recently entered into an agreement with a company to operate our expanding digital parking system.  As an extension of this agreement, we are considering migrating parking enforcement over to them, as well as investing in license plate recognition technology to streamline and improve the enforcement process.\nAre there any communities who can provide a synopsis of their experiences privatizing parking enforcement?  Do any communities have experience with transitioning to a LPR system, and can you speak of a corresponding return on investment?  What political or organizational barriers were faced when considering this transition and/or investment in upgrading enforcement technology?\nI thank you for your feedback and input!\n-Joe\n\n",
