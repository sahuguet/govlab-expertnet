  "text": "\n\nI am looking for council approved user fee policies from communities with populations greater than 100,000.  I'm hoping to find policies that utilize \"best practices\", clearly explain when, why and how certain fees increase and provide a timeline for reviewing and increasing/decreasing fees.  Does anyone have such a policy?  If so, could you please attach it to this question?\nThank you!\nKathryn Hertel\nCity of Raleigh\n\n",
