  "text": "\n\nGood morning Colleagues!\nCan anyone share Economic Development models that you are familiar with or use in your area that provide accurate impacts of investments made in your City or County through grants/incentives. Mecklenburg County provides business investment grants to businesses that wish to relocate in our area. We are considering whether or not we should develop a new model or if there are already reliable models that exist? Any insight would be helpful. Thanks in advance. \nTimmothy\nTimmothy.Tibbs@MecklenburgCountyNC.Gov\n704-432-2163\n\n",
