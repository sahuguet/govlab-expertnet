One way to potentially navigate that issue, which could result in people seeking to avoid the potential perceptions surrounding their work being completed by others, particularly in today's economic climate, is to structure/frame the opportunity as a formal organizational training requirement. Afterall, all departments need expertise in budgeting and performance measurement; there's no better place for that training than in one's own organization, and ther's no substitute for trying to put all of the pieces together during budget crunch time.\n\n\nSeems like a great idea and would support succession planning, though it's sort of like a temp assignment to another department than an \"internship.\" One of the questions could be how best to handle workload reassignment in the role vacated by the \"staff intern.\" There may even be concern about how it could look to others when 1/4 or 1/2 half of one's responsibilities can be reassigned to another party without adverse organizational impact, i.e., why is a FT position required for those responsibilities if they can effectively be completed by others in one's absence.

  "text": "\n\nI have asked our Leadership Team if they would be able and interested in providing one of their staff to serve as an intern in our office (Budget and Performance Management) during the budget development period.  My thought is that the person would continue to be paid by his/her home department but work for me at least part time.  Has anyone else done something similar?  If so, how many hours did this person work?  What expections were outlined for that person?  Any thoughts on this are appreciated.\nThanks!\nLeslie Beauregard\n\n",
