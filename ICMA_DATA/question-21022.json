These online forums typically get 3 to over 10 times the amount of citizen participation from conventional public hearings. Also, the forums can be easily integrated with local government social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter). I appended below links to a variety of examples.

Their responses were added to the in room ones for a very powerful message! We had about 40 in the room and about another 30 participate remotely. It was a big hit, and got good press.  - Tom\n\n\nWe did a cool, low cost outreach about a year and a half ago using a live group that we televised over our cable TV and streaming on the net.

They did a neat exercise where residents got to \"pick\" what to keep and what to get rid of...definitely showed how hard it is to make those tough decisions. Justin Golbabai works in their Budget Office and is a KUCIMAT...you can contact him.\nAlso City of Round Rock did an exercise a few years ago where they brought residents in to do an exercise where they picked what level of service they wanted (they called the levels Lexus, Camry and Corolla). It was interactive and fun. If you want more info, email me.\n\n\nHi Nickie-\n\n(Congrats on Olathe!) You may want to check out what the City of Austin did last year.

  "text": "\n\nWe have hosted \"traditional\" budget input meetings over the past few years with low turnout. We have made presentations at City Hall and traveled to locations thorughout the city, but would like to try something new this year to encourage more citizen involvement. We are looking into hosting an \"E Town Hall Meeting\", allowing citizens to submit questions about the 2012 budget online via email, social media, etc. Has anyone tried this kind of meeting, and how successful has it been? Any advice as we move ahead? Thanks!\n\n",
