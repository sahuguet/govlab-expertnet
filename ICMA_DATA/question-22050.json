Please note that the retirement incentive is not an early retirement incentive, but rather an incentive for individuals who were already retirement eligible.  This incentive did not address individuals who were in public safety.  Also, you want to verify the impact on your retirement system as to whether implementing such a program creates an unfunded liability.  Hope this helps.\n\n\nMatt,\n\nPlease find attached information regarding the City of Peoria's retirement plan/voluntary severance plans used to address budget deficits.

If you are a City that has implemented such a program I would be interested to see what your policy is/was, including payout program, insurance and any other benefits.\nThanks,\nMatt McQuillen\nCity of Clive\n\n",
