Next, as Richard says, there needs to be a risk analysis of what the exposures in the community are. However, you can never staff for the \"worst case scenario rare event.\" Rather any staffing plan should have a shared services component - either automatic or call in mutual aid. Next there needs to be a meaningful assessment of station locations,  which drives response time.\nIf your city provides EMS (either two tier or response and transport) the analysis must consider that the vast majority of calls will be medical.

      "text": "\n\nAs a retired Fire Chief, a career fire service professional, and a public safety consultant,  I have conducted numerous resource allocation, staffing and deployment studies for municipalities and special district fire departments.  These studies can be quite labor intensive and can be strongly embraced or rejected based on how you approach the project.  It's important to remember this type of study can only be successful if all interested parties are willing to accept the outcomes of the study.  Frequently these studies are used, by fire department staff to make an argument for additional resources, or by the management staff to justify the reduction of resources.  Either way, if the study is not conducted objectively it can cause great controversy within the organization which is a topic for another discussion. \nI strongly recommend you conduct a comprehensive study of the overall service demands currently placed on the fire department using an outsider's perspective.  This will certainly require that you find a neutral party to conduct an objective study of how services are delivered,  the factors driving the increase in service demand, the efficiency of your fire public education services and the effectiveness of your fire prevention program.  The key here is to make sure there the justification for the study is to address demands for service and to find a better way of doing business.  \nFor that you'll need to find a consulting firms that can conduct the assessment of service delivery using up to date technology such as GIS data to ensure all response data is accurate and can be tabulated using up to date programs. \nOnce you determine what is driving the change then you can begin to discuss things like staffing needs, extinguishing agents and other methods of addressing the issue.  \nStudies of this nature will run anywhere from $15 - $25K depending on the size of the department and the number of meetings that are conducted with staff and administrators. \nIf you are interested in discussing this  in greater detail please drop me a note and I will contact you.  My e-mail is chrisbosch1@sbcglobal.net \nGood luck.\n\n\nAs a retired Fire Chief, a career fire service professional, and a public safety consultant,  I have conducted numerous resource allocation, staffing and deployment studies for municipalities and special district fire departments.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Las Cruces, NM is interested in the topic of fire department staffing levels, models, studies or criteria used by paid fire departments.  As with many other jurisdictions, we care challenged with trying to keep pace with a growing community in a financial environment that makes it difficult to add personnel resources.\nI realize there are many different ways to provide service in the fire protection field and am interested in learning what other communities are doing in these areas.\nThank you,\nTravis A Brown, Fire Chief\nLas Cruces Fire Department\n575-528-3473\ntbrown@las-cruces.org\n\n",
