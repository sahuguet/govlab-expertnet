  "text": "\n\nHi all,\nI'm working as the manager for the Small Communities Track at the ICMA Annual Conference in Milwaukee this fall.  Doug Schulze, the leader/moderator for a session entitled, \"Too Many Hats,\" would like to identify 4-6 managers and/or administrators who have seen it all and done it all to discuss how small community managers can stay on top of the work that needs to be done.\nYou won't need to prepare a formal presentation, just be willing to participate in a Q&A session and share from your own experiences.\nIf you're planning on being at Milwaukee and would like to participate in this discussion, please drop me a line at cfleming@icma.org or give me a call at 207-854-1083.\nMany thanks for your interest,\nCory Fleming\n\n",
