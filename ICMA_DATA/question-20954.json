Meaning things like environmental procurement, integrated pest management, water and energy conservation, green fleet, local organic food, green cleaning, etc.  We are embarking on such an initiative in San Jose and I would like to know what's already been done elsewhere.\nThanks,\nLinden Skjeie\nCity of San Jose Environmental Services Department\n\n",
