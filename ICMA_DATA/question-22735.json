  "text": "\n\nFerndale looks to address water customers who are or have experienced hardship and wish to negotiate payment plans on their utilities.  To date, these cases have been handled individually, and some what arbitrarily.  I would like to establish some sort Hardship Payment Plan that may be modeled after a property tax hardship plan.  The solution likely will not resolve all hardship type accounts, but at least we have done our due dilligence to address the problem in a thoughtful way.  \nInitial Results that we seek:\nCriteria for hardship documentation\nStandard monthly payment plan (moving hardship customers away from quarterly billing)\nAlleviation of current penalty's: (Potential inaugural amnesty period)\nAchieving compensation for consumption, continuing to provide water service to hardship customers, solution is as equitable as can be to both parties.\n\n",
