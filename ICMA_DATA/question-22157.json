I believe some of the more robust ones will even track phone traffic.  But even if not, at least you will be able to track your responsiveness to the calls that are then entered into the system by your staff.  We are getting ready to go live with PublicStuff here but I used GovQA before which interfaces seemlessly with your website.  All of these are set up to provide for maximum response times and allow you to see the status of all requests and then report on how responsive you are.\n\n\nI would suggest that you look into one of the many CRM systems available out there which allow management to track staff's responsiveness to complaints and requests for service.

If responsiveness is subjective, then a subjective measure of the clients' feelings would be most helpful.\nA low-budget solution could measure clients' changing impressions with SurveyMonkey. \"Does HR help you promptly? Do they forget about you?\" In house, the voicemail greetings and email signatures would promise: \"I will get back to you within the next business day.\" And the team would make that a priority. They could make posters by hand one afternoon. Such simple changes might really help and could be in place quickly at little cost.\n\n\nOr is it the impression of the black hole which is the problem?

  "text": "\n\nI have been working with our Human Resources department for the past 12 months on a process improvement project.  One of the final report recommendations was to establish performance measures to track responsiveness, because it seems as though voice mails and e-mails would regularly go into this \u201cblack hole\u201d and are not returned in a timely manner (24-48 hours). \nWe interested in adopting a measure that captures our responsiveness in replying to emails, phonecalls, and voicemails. Do any of your communities measure responsiveness-- both in the actual measure/target set, and how you physically track responses to verify whether the employee actually responded within the target time? \nThanks for your assistance!\n\n",
