  "text": "\n\nI am a member of a community activist group, www.davisandhighhouse.org, that is concerned about a plan by our town, Cary, NC, to annex and develop 12,000 acres of farmland that lies on a peninsula that juts out into our drinking water supply and exemplifies \"urban sprawl\".  Although I believe our town is among the best run in the country, I have concerns because no financial impact analysis was presented to the Town Council, the Planning and Zoning Committee, or residents when the plan was put up for discussion.  Because municipal services must be provided at quite a distance from the rest of the town, residents are concerned about the costs of providing police, fire, waste, building inspections, etc., and we are concerned about the additional costs associated with removing nitrogen, phosphates, and sediments from our already \"impaired\" drinking water supply.  Therefore, we would like an independent party to prepare a financial impact analysis for the proposed plan.  Can you recommend someone who could serve as a consultant on this topic?  Thanks!\nRegards,\nKarl Thor\n\n",
