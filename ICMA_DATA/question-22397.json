  "text": "\n\nI currently work for a Fleet Management Department with a municipality in North Carolina and purchasing a heavy duty lift is one of the department's top priorities. Even though we see that there is a need to have a heavy duty lift since we don't currently have one, we must justify the reasons in having one. Could someone please provide me with some benefits of getting a heavy duty lift instead of not having one at all?\n\n",
