      "text": "\n\nAs noted by Chief Jenkins, I believe you are going to want to review NFPA 1710 rather than NFPA 1720 for compliance issues. NFPA 1710 pertains only to all-career departments; 1720 pertains to volunteer, combination, public safety and any other department outside of all-career. \nBoth standards are voluntary and not mandated to be adopted. Also remember that neither standard should be looked at from simply the standpoint of response time; in many cases response time (particularly in EMS) has no affect on outcomes and hurrying may actually increase the liability and risk to a community.  Both standards require a community to conduct an all-hazard, all-risk analysis, review data and calls for service, and deploy resources matching the risk and hazards with acceptable performance as promulgated by the authority having jurisdiction. The AHJ determines the acceptable deployment methodology meeting the needs desired or expected by the community. Response time is but one metric to analyze performance.  \nI would agree that the Center for Public Safety Excellence, Inc. (CPSE) and its fire accreditation may be a good place to find comparables. However, comparing only on a response time basis could result in deploying resources in an unsustainable method. In addition to response time, an analysis should also look at workload, calls, resource exhaustion, mitigation, and alternative service delivery models. Getting to the scene in 4 minutes may or may not result in a successful outcome if the Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) patient is on the 26th floor of a building, requires extrication, or if the notification for a responding vehicle took a lengthy amount of time. The 1720 model does incorporate some good methodology for community risk reduction and assessment while the 1710 standard focuses more on the time and staffing elements. CPSM is always available to assist communities with this analytical process using a managerial approach.\n\n\nAs noted by Chief Jenkins, I believe you are going to want to review NFPA 1710 rather than NFPA 1720 for compliance issues.

Ideally we would like to see a list for cities of similar size to Milwaukee, populations of 500,000 or greater.  If anyone is aware of such a list I would appreciate being contacted with that information.\n\n",
