  "text": "\n\nIn the Council/Manager form, we talk about the Council setting policy and the Manager recommending and implementing those policies. Sounds great in concept, but digging into the matter reveals some less than fully helpful definitions, and a blurry dividing line.   In addition, most if not all City Managers probably experience a period when the Council forgets or ignores the pure model, and starts delving into operations.  \nI recognize that one has to be careful here; no manager wins by becoming too doctrinaire.  \nHowever, does anyone have access to one or more good documents that explore in some detail what the policy realm really is and what the operations realm really is..  Having helpful resources from  credible outside sources to share with Council candidates and to bring out when the dividing line becomes too blurry could be of considerable value.  We are starting to update our Council candidate orientation packet.\n\n",
