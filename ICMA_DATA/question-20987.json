  "text": "\n\nThe City of Wilsonville, Oregon is exploring the use of an historic barn as a location for concessions to the park.    City code does not allow 'vending', and special events provide concessions as part of their park reservation, but the use of a public facility for daily assigned service of snack foods has not been addressed.\nWe are looking for samples of city codes, policies, business license formats, or established plans that provide for the provision of concessions served out of public parks.   \nIn addition, any information on how the concession is selected, if there is a charge or a % of profit for the concession, and/or if non-profit organizations are scheduled.\nThank you for any/all of your knowledge you can share.\nPeggy Watters\nCommunity Services Director\n\n",
