  "text": "\n\nHello,\nI am a 2012 Michigan Local Government (MLGMA) Fellow and I am doing my Capstone on Succession Planning. I wanted to ask a few research questions. Please see the following. I would be very appreciative of your feedback and responses. \nQuestions: If you are a department head or a City Manager and practicing Succession Planning? If so, do you have a formalized or informal plan? If it is an informal plan, what are the hindrances you face to formalize the plan?\nThank you\n\n",
