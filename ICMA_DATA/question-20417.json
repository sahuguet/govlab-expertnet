  "text": "\n\nVery interesting short blog article about how special assessment districts should be created to fund public transit infrastructure improvements. \nHere is the article:  http://marketurbanism.com/2010/09/13/internalizing-positive-transit-externalities/\nLots of good points.  In Alexandria, VA, direct access to Metro service can mean $40,000 in higher value for a 3 bedroom, 3 bath townhouse vs. one not within walking distance of a Metro.  \nWhat do you think?  Unfair for those that do not utilize public transit services?\n\n",
