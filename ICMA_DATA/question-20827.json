      "text": "\n\nA preliminary advanced Google search for RFP documents for village attorneys-at-law directed me to a PDF (\\ http://bit.ly/dGNSKB) filed in the Village of Maple Park, Illinois. Like Cassopolis, this small rural community sought to contract a lawyer or legal firm to provide representation to and perform legal work on behalf of the village. After a brief telephone conversation with a representative of Maple Park, I am pleased to inform you that their RFP drew a very satisfactory response. \nFurther investigation brought me to the following PDF (http://bit.ly/e1p1QN) filed in the City of McCall, Idaho. Slightly larger than Cassopolis, this resort town was in pursuit of a one year contract for a city prosecutor. While attempts to reach the city manager of McCall ultimately proved fruitless, this RFP is an adequate specimen.\nMy final search for a suitable RPF rendered the following example (http://bit.ly/h88VNN) filed by the City of Vernonia, Oregon. Only slightly larger than McCall, Veronia was also in search of an attorney-at-law to represent and provide legal advice to their city. While a very through document on the whole, this RPF failed to include a telephone number. As such I am incapable of determining whether this RPF met its mark.\n\n\nA preliminary advanced Google search for RFP documents for village attorneys-at-law directed me to a PDF (\\ http://bit.ly/dGNSKB) filed in the Village of Maple Park, Illinois.
