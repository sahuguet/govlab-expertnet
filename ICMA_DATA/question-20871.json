Here's a link: http://www.ci.richland.wa.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=1321\nThe process has indeed been time consuming and for some, all encompassing. It includes extensive citizen input and commitment from the governing body.  Still, it has led to a focused approach to delivering city services.  To me, it's hard to have a forward-moving organization without some kind of planning process.\n\n\nHi Jessica,\nThe City of Richland, WA has successfully implemented a strategic plan that guides their day to day efforts as well as employee performance management process.

If the plan is addressing only actios or activities, it will always be useless.\nb) How aligned is the plan to the City Vision\nc) How is linked to a monitoring dashboard. If the plan is not monitored, cannot be useful.\n\n\nHi Jessica,\nI think the strategic plan could be useful or useless, but depends on:\na) How the plan defines planned \"achievements\" and not just \"actions\".

      "text": "\n\nMost plans--strategic or otherwise--end up as \"door stops.\"  I concur with Jose, plans must be monitored.  I would go one step further... elected bodies must be committed to implementing the plans over the long term.  This is a problem because elected officials sweep into office with a sense of \"mandate\" from the people... and they generally feel that their political mandate supercedes any strategic plan crafted by a previous administration.  Strategic planning works better in the private sector where shifts in governance are not so frequent (or dramatic).  If the academics favoring strategic planning want to do something useful, they could start by convincing elected officials that planning should trump politics.\n\n\nMost plans--strategic or otherwise--end up as \"door stops.\"  I concur with Jose, plans must be monitored.

  "text": "\n\nAs a second-year graduate student in an MPA program, I am focusing my final professional paper on strategic planning in local governments (I am referring to planning in general, not just zoning and land use).  Stats show that over half of medium-large cities do not engage in integrated, comprehensive, long-term planning; this goes against much of the academic literature on the value of strategic planning.  I am curious: why should (or should not) municipalities use this planning model?  Several administrators I have spoken with cite time, resources, and rapidly changing environments as the main reason they don't use it.  Thoughts?  \nThank you!\n\n",
