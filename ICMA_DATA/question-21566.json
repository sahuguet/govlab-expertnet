One advantage is that it can be pre applied to streets prior to storms and it helps keep the temperature of the asphalt/concrete higher in preparation for snow events.  Mag chloride works well and is a cost effective alternative to salt.  At least that is the case where I am in northern Idaho/eastern Washington area.\nMagnesium chloride is more environmentally friendly than salt or brine.  It does not have a deleterious impact upon vegetation and is not as corrosive to metals and to concrete surfaces as well.\n\n\nOur community has utilized magnesium chloride quite successfully as a salt alternative.

The county I work for has reduced the amount of salt used during winter weather events significantly over the course of the past few seasons. The use of computer assisted technology has helped reduce the use of excess salt. In addition, Dakota County is exploring alternatives such as beet juice derivatives for de-icing (http://tinyurl.com/6vs9uze). Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions, I'll do my best to help.\n\n\nI am far from an expert on the subject, but the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency provides an interesting and helpful guide here (http://tinyurl.com/7dcljp7).
