  "text": "\n\nI am getting ready to write an RFI, and eventually an RFP, to obtain the services of a billing company or consultant to help us move towards a fee for service for EMS.  We currently do not charge for these services.  We have a small committee that is working on this plan and we have some differing opinions of what a billing company or consultant will do to help us implement the project.  This is the purpose of starting with an RFI.  Any information or documents would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
