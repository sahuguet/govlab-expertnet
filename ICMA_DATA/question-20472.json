I later stopped using them because I found they created an element of segregation that spurred jealousies and resentments that some get more then others or are favored. What I then did was form teams that included all these folks to develop , training and personal development programs and then made sure there were elements that dealt properly and effectively with all of these individual concerns. \nIt is hard enough in large complex organizations to create a sense we are all one team without creating fragmentation in focus or interest.  I know this may go against convention, but it is what I found to be the reality.  I believe we had great success in the the approaches we did take.  Of course I start with the premise that every person deserves fair and equal opportunity to succeed, that the not be discriminated against for any reason and would not tolerate anyone that did discriminate.  Without that commitment at the out set, the organization will be beset with problems.\n\n\nI originally promoted such special interest forums.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Scottsdale, AZ is interesting in learning what other agencies are doing with Employee Resource Groups, sometimes referred to as Employee Networks.  Groups that are generally organized by individuals connected by a shared background, experience or like interest (Women, Disability, Ethnic Groups, Generations, Gay-Straight Alliance, etc.). Often times, their purpose is to promote professional development and growth, provide opportunities for networking and to support the business strategies of the organization.   \nPlease send copies/links to your Employee Resource/Network Groups (policies, documentation, etc.).  \nThank you,  \nPam\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450\npmuse@transformgov.org\nwww.transformgov.org\n\n",
