      "text": "\n\nMary,\nHow to appropriately use social media is one of the more frequently asked questions on the Knowledge Network. With the explosion of blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other forms of Web 2.0 technologies, many governments are anxious to put an oar in the water but are also uncertain/concerned that there may be pitfalls or unintended consequences to using these new and still developing platforms. What is appropriate/inappropriate to post or blog about? Should each department have it's own blog and or should the government speak with one, unified voice? How do you manage aspects of social media like the comments or Wall sections of a Facebook page? Do you let citizens/employees post whatever they want and risk becoming tangled in politics or do you strictly manage and delete inappropriate comments and risk accusations of censorship?\nTo that end, I would first and foremost point you to the Alliance for Innovation's Social Media Topic Page, which contains dozens of articles, reports and sample policies from local governments that will guide you as you search for the \"right\" way to use social media to engage with your employees. \nhttp://transformgov.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/281/Social_Media#Tab=Documents\nWhile many of the articles/reports focus on social media communication from government to the public, many of the issues addressed could also apply to an interoffice blog among city or town employees. An example is ensuring that your blog is set up to be a two-way means of communication from management to staff and vice versa. This principle is true whether you want to communicate with your staff or the public at large. The following two articles contain advice and guidelines that may be useful to keep in mind when setting up your interoffice blog:\nWeb 2.0: New Rules of Communication: http://transformgov.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/document/100002/web_20_new_rules_of_communication\nSocial Networking Technology: A New Tool or Another Headache?: http://transformgov.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/document/3527/social_networking_technology__new_tool_or_another_headache\nI'm on the lookout for any reports/articles that specifically deal with inter-office social media use. If I find anything of relevance I'll post it. Good luck!\nDerek Johnson\n\n\nMary,\n\nHow to appropriately use social media is one of the more frequently asked questions on the Knowledge Network.

The blog space would be intended for employees to participate in conversations led by the Village Manager on topics such as leadership, employee engagement, and innovative ideas. We are also aware that an interoffice blog could be a risky venture, especially when it comes time for union contract negotiations. Have any of your municipalities tried hosting open interoffice conversations through blogs or any other venue? What are the opportunities and challenges you faced?\n\n",
