We have found that a great many of our residents have Fridays off and conduct any village business on that day. Obviously, the police department has a different schedule. Our DPW also stays on the five day work week, however, on fridays they come in earlier and are finished early.  The four day work week has been utilized to great success here at the Village Hall.\n\n\nMr. Wise,\nHave you considered a four day, ten hours schedule at all?

We actually closed city hall and other administrative offices on that second Friday. The work week schedule was adjusted to account for the change, as you discuss.\n\n\nRC - the City of Tracy, California moved  to this type of 9/80 schedule with the second Friday off, in the mid to late 1990's.

      "text": "\n\nMr Wise,\nSuppose Friday is the alternating 8-hour \"flex\" day and its shift begins at 8am. The work week would at noon on Friday and run until noon the next Friday. \nwork week example: \nWeek #1 M9 + T9 + W9 +Th9 + F4 (1/2 of Friday 8am-12pm) = 40\nWeek #2 F4 (1/2 of Friday 12pm-...) + M9 + T9 + W9 + Th9 = 40\nWhen transitioning an employee to this schedule, the employee's first week will be the flex week with Friday off and the employee will do a one-time 10/4/40 week: M10 T10 W10 Th10 F(off) and the new work week will begin on that off Friday at noon. Once decided upon, the flex day cannot change to avoid any overtime occurrence.\n\n\nMr Wise,\nSuppose Friday is the alternating 8-hour \"flex\" day and its shift begins at 8am.

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have experience with the 9/8/80 schedule where individuals work nine nine-hour days and one eight hour day in a two-week period and get either a Monday or Friday off every two weeks.\nThis schedule seems intriguing and I believe would involve splitting the regular work week time in order to avoid paying overtime on the weeks when 44 hours are worked.\nAny sample schedules that you can share would be greatly appreciated.\nRC Wise\n\n",
