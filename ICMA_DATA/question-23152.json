  "text": "\n\nOne of our members has had several high profile cases at different bars recently and are looking for some best practice information from other communities in managing alcohol consumption.  They are specifically looking for whether or not there are any communities that have requirements for the use of, placement of, the monitoring of camera systems, and policies dealing with cameras in liquor establishments.  Also, are there any communities that offer any sort of incentive to licensed establishments for catching, confiscating and turning in fake ID\u2019s?\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nGreg Stopka\nCentral Regional Director\n\n",
