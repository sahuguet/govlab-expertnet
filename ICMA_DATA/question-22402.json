Along with that, each department reviews budget data by major categories (payroll/benefits, operations, capital, debt, etc.) and we only dig into the line item detail to answer questions.  We provide the budget book at least a week ahead of time to enable Councilmembers to review beforehand and be ready with questions.  Our work sessions now take about 3-4 hours each on two successive evenings.  The approval of the budget then usually appears on the regular meeting agenda for first reading about 1-2 weeks later.\n\n\nThe City of Oberlin budget work sessions include a high-level review of each department (key accomplishments or performance indicators for the prior FY, highlights in the upcoming FY and notable changes from the prior FY, goals for the upcoming FY, capital projects, and unmet needs or notable budget reductions).

We currently have several worksessions between the proposed and adopted budget and am interested in learing about what others do specifically what's presented to them (big picture, line items, etc.)?\nThanks!\nLeslie Beauregard\n\n",
