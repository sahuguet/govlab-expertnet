  "text": "\n\nI am curious to know if there are any Florida cities who provide information centers inside their government buildings where people can pick up brochures, flyers, pamphlets, etc. from the community. I am looking to create one inside City Hall in North Port, and wanted to know if there are Florida agencies who have policies in place on how to handle such a spot inside a government building.\nPlease let me know.\nSincerely,\nErin Bryce, Community Outreach Manager\nCity of North Port, Florida\nebryce@cityofnorthport.com\n\n",
