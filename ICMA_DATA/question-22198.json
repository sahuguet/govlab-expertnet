Several years ago, I was an ACA for West Palm Beach with a lead role in its economic development.  The downtown hosts two major events which are SunFest and the Annual Boat Show which do draw tens of thousands to the city and through the downtown.   Its actual value for the city as an economic development engine is a never ending debate because of the other hard to measure variable for such activities which is overall economic benefit.  It has always been relatively accurate to measure attendance by ticket sales and police estimates of crowds in the various venues but what has always been tough to measure is what is the actual value to the city's overall economy and especially to the businesses in the downtown.  On the latter, what I have found is that the most \"real\" and credible method to use is old fashioned communication either directly to the businesses or through business organizations.  In the case of West Palm Beach, it is the DDA and the Chamber of Commerce.  I hope this is of help.\n\n\nTracy, there are firms in the field of economic development that will make a case that they have the means and formula driven measures to provide such information but, in reality, because of the nature of what is being measured especially downtown dynamics and major events it really comes down to reasoned guess work for which there is not a need to shell out precious funds for a firm to provide such best guesses.
