  "text": "\n\nOur City of approximately 56,000 residents has been approached by a local business person who wants to provide cash donations to the City Parks & Recreation Department for naming rights at one of the City's sports complexes.  The complex is comprised of four baseball fields, one multi-purpose field and will soon house a football field (not stadium).  I am looking for any other jurisdictions who have implemented a naming rights policy and/or program as well as the methodology used for establishing the value.  Any assistance would be appreciated and I can be reached directly at slewis@port-orange.org.  Thank you.\nShannon Lewis, Assistant City Manager, City of Port Orange, FL\n\n",
