I hope local government officials chime in and share their policies on this issue as we do not have example permit request forms for this type of public art yet on the Knowledge Network. \nHowever we do have an article on public art and public painting permits. \"How Hacking City Policy Can Improve the Public Realm\" discusses how to make public art, such as graffiti, permitting more simple so that it encourages people to create art legally instead of defacing public structures. \nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/103396/Better_Planning_Better_Cities\nI hope that this article helps your member and that if they are able to create their own policy on this issue that they upload it to the Knowledge Network so others can benefit from their policy. \nBest,\nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Pamela, \n\nThank you for the great question!
