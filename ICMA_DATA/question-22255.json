  "text": "\n\nI am now retired and would like to have my account closed and the funds sent to another location.  What information do you need for this to happen?  What issues will I confront, such as taxes, etc.  Can the distribution be done incrementally to minimize taxation...as in over two tax years?\nAlso, when I tried to call the computer asked for a PIN, as far as I know I have never had a PIN for this account.\nPlease advise...B.\n\n",
