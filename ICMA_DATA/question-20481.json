Nevertheless, by looking at several city programs, the following are some pros and cons for a take home program: \n\nProgram Costs: While most agencies experienced higher capital costs, ultimately they realized a reduction in total program expenses through reductions in maintenance costs.\nDown Time: Officers are found to report car problems much earlier in take home cars thereby reducing the extended down time periods for major repairs. \nVehicle Longevity: Agencies report single-user vehicles last longer with an average life span around 5 years. This is due to the reduced amount of actual engine hours per year and the better care and treatment a take home car receives. \nCriminal Activity: While difficult to quantify, citizens with police cars in their neighborhoods believe the cruiser deters crime.\nProductivity: An officer is ready to \u201cgo to work\u201d when leaving home rather than spending time picking up a cruiser and checking for all needed equipment. \nShift Transitions: Without the time spent meeting up with another officer and trading equipment, officers coming on duty were immediately available for patrol coverage. Lag time on responses to calls for service due to shift change procedure decreased. \nEmergency Response: Incidents requiring urgent response from off-duty officers have enjoyed a quicker response time from officers coming directly from their homes to the scene. \nOfficer Morale: Officers take more pride in the condition and appearance of their own cars and equipment. \n\nThe cons to a program tend to be about monetary issues, but the following are worth considering:\n1.  Take-home vehicles increase operating costs and capital replacement expenditures. The argument is that taking a vehicle home reduces the economic life of a vehicle. If it is driven 33 percent for take-home use, a vehicle\u2019s business life is reduced by one-third, and must be replaced earlier than the same vehicle not being driven home. \n2.  The expense of acquiring additional vehicles so one vehicle can be assigned per officer. \n3.  Take-home vehicles increase liability exposure for the city, especially during off-duty usage. \n4.  Misuse of a take-home vehicle can result in noncompliance with federal tax requirements. Fringe benefits, such as use of a vehicle for commuting purposes or medical benefits, are considered a form of pay. \n5.  If the policy allows, those employees commuting 40-100 miles in outlying areas don\u2019t pay the commuting costs, taxpayers will. \nFor take home requirements: \nIn Daytona Beach, officers must live within 10 miles of the Daytona Beach border to be eligible for a home take-home vehicle. Officers who live beyond the 10 miles limit can still use a specific vehicle; however, they must leave it within the city\u2019s border while off-duty, such as in the parking lot of a retail shopping center. \nIn addition, I have attached West Palm Beach Police Department\u2019s policy regarding take home vehicles that can provide you with further information. \nFor additional information you may want to look at the following articles: \nBenefits in Take Home Programs: \nhttp://www.government-fleet.com/Channel/Disaster-Planning/Article/Story/2007/05/Fleets-Find-Benefits-in-Take-Home-Programs.aspx \nAnalysis for Police Fleet Magazine: \nhttp://www.policedriving.com/article48.htm \nCost-Benefit Analysis performed by a consulting firm for Tacoma, WA: \nhttp://www.cityoftacoma.org/Page.aspx?hid=2051 \nGalloway Township Benefits: \nhttp://www.gtpd.org/lexington.html\n\n\nThe pros and cons of a police take home vehicle program vary depending on a jurisdictions program finances, local political and community objectives, and the operational needs of the department.
