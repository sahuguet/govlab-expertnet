These forums have attracted over 70,000 attendees and garnered a user-satisfaction rating of over 96%. \nIn comparison to the other services that you mentioned, the key distinguishing benefits of Open Town Hall are that its forums are civil (as online blogs are full of vitriol and misinformation), and legal (in contrast to companies and bloggers, government agencies have legal requirements). The Open Town Hall forums also have great analysis tools and the forums are easy to setup and use. \nThe company is an AFI strategic partner -- so AFI members get a 10% discount on pricing. \nMike (866-535-8894 x701)\n\n\nMary Ann,  \n\nCheck-out Peak Democracy Inc's Open Town Hall online public comment platform:  http://www.OpenTownHall.com  .  \n\nPeak Democracy has powered over 700 online public comment forums from over 40 government agencies.
