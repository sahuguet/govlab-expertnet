      "text": "\n\nHi David, \nThanks for your question. It sounds like you may be referring to data available through the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement (CPM). If so, since Oklahoma City is a CPM participant, you may access any data available from the program through the private section of CPM's website at icma.org/cpm.  \nThe Permits service area was newly established in 2009, thus data is available only to that year (although most other service areas have data available as far back as 2003). A small number of permitting questions were included in the Code Enforcement service area for several years prior to 2009, so you may find what you're looking for in one of the Code Enforcement date files. \nFor specific assistance with either the Code Enforcement or Permitting data sets, management associate Corey Orlosky (corlosky@icma.org) is a great resource. Also, please feel free to contact CPM's front desk (cpmmail@icma.org) for speedier service on any CPM-related topic. \nAgain, thanks, and please don't hesitate to contact me (lsnyder@icma.org) for assistance, too.\n\n\nHi David, \nThanks for your question.
