Specifically, we are facing an increasing number of emergency detentions, i.e. prisoners threatening to do harm to themselves of someon else.  The result is we are required to transport and house these inmates in a secure dention, (secure hospital setting).  \nMy question is does anyone have an effective protocol or mechanism to address these issues without having to incur the additional costs of a secure mental health facility?\nThank you and any information you can provide is apprecaited.\n\n",
