I was poking through an old copy of PM Magazine, and I came across an article that discussed how San Antonio was able to use a 311 system to better respond to the needs of its citizens. \n(http://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/381; http://webapps.icma.org/pm/8811/public/feature1.cfm?author=cory%20fleming%20and%20bryan%20barnhouse&title=customer%20service%20is%20just%203%20digits%20away%20in%20san%20antonio)\nI also tracked down an interesting tactic for citizen engagement employed by Arlington, VA that you truly have to see to believe.

This may sound basic - but start with how your customer see the Department - in Temple Terrace we found that simple changes such as the hours of operation had a lot to do with how we were able to serve the public and improve service.  For example, most contractors and building trades go to work early in the morning - having a government office that opens at 9 really restricts them from coming in - when we changed our opening hour to 7 both compliance and cooperation increased.  Same goods with virtual tools to do on-line permitting - look inward from those using it - is it really user-friendly - maybe ask some key players for their suggestions - if they recommend and approve of the changes - they can be some of your best sales people in the trade.  This same logic comes into plan when you design office space - what is the flow of traffic - does the office seem like a bureacratic institution or one that encourages public access. Are the offices your Department and customer needs to work with nearby - do you have a way to reduce their walking from one office to another just to get a permit - think again how they see it and I think you will be amazed at how simple the answers really become with this attitude.\n\n\nWhile serving as the Community Development Director and Department Head for the Building and Zoning Office for the City of Temple Terrace Florida we were able to take a number of common sense measures to improve the customer service of our operations that may be worth consideration.
