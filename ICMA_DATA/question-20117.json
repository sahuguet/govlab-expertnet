      "text": "\n\nInternships work best for exempt-type job duties, particularly working in the Chief Executive's office, or assisting with an appointed board or committee on a particular project.  Otherwise, you might have union issues to contend with.  When I interned, I did a lot of research, and helped reformat the budget book to meet GFOA standards.  Also worked on a few projects, including their Community Resource Inventory and their Disaster Recovery Plan.  Due to unexpected office turnover, I also took over some purchasing and HR duties for a substantial length of time, which really added a stressful element to the internship but also gave me an excellent foundation for handling administrative duties and multitasking.   MPA interns can usually do a diverse range of tasks.  In my case, I brought a lot of research and analytical skills and could write books worth of reports, but I also had a lot of learning to do when it came to the simple things that come with working in an office, because I'd had so little prior work experience.  I was never a behavioral issue, just a bit administratively-clumsy, let's say, and still learning the dress codes, office-speak, how to stay organized and manage tasks and deadlines, etc (all things I got the hang of pretty quickly but not without a few bumps in the road)...  So interns can require some patience, but  everyone has to start somewhere and you can get some quality work at a very low cost to the organization.  If they're a behavioral issue, you can get rid of them in a heartbeat with essentially no repercussions or risk of suit.  But they do require some tight management if they don't have a lot of professional work history besides McDonalds and college jobs, so it's best to hand off projects & duties that aren't incredibly time-sensitive.  Throwing an intern in the deep end fo the pool to see if they can swim provides them with some very valuable training, but can also add a lot of stress and uncertainty to your life and potentially put them in the position of making fatal mistakes... so on one hand I encourage it but on the other I'd say do so with caution.\nBut without internships, there won't be a supply of government officials to step up as the older generations retire, so by providing some entry level opportunities to students of government, you're doing a great service for the industry!\n\n\nInternships work best for exempt-type job duties, particularly working in the Chief Executive's office, or assisting with an appointed board or committee on a particular project.

Basically, the laws are overly stringent and were put into place for one overarching reason, that speaks to your concerns: unpaid interns are expected to be taught the trade without necessary contributing \u201cimmediate advantages to the employer.\u201d  The idea here is that unions and other full-time employees won\u2019t feel threatened by the unpaid intern if they [the intern] are not given immediate, vital work (but instead something like a long-term project, that requires less supervision and gives them a taste of the skills and thought processes necessary to excel).\nAt the same time that these laws quell the fears of unions, the management process expected is that the internship provider (in this case, your local government) will provide what is essentially vocational training in working for a local government, while the intern provides support capabilities.  Now, the recent controversies over unpaid internships of early 2010 highlight the problems with the stringencies of these laws: unpaid internships are often what propel a student\u2019s resume into being viable to get them hired (because in addition to providing support roles and learning the trade through direct experience).  It will be important to keep this in mind and figure out a balance between engaging unpaid an intern in support roles and mixing in some substantive, resume-building projects.\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Alexandra:\n\nIn addition to the excellent answers already given, I would point you to the federal government\u2019s laws governing unpaid internships, which are at http://community2.business.gov/t5/Business-Law-Advisor/The-Truth-Behind-Unpaid-Internships/ba-p/9340.

I love the idea of providing meaningful experiences for interns, but I'm concerned about the manageability of additional people, as well as implications with our labor unions.  Has anyone had experience with this scenario?\n\n",
