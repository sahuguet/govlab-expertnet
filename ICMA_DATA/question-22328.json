They are used mostly by Public Works staff to shuttle between a handful of destinations in the ten-square mile city and the surrounding county, for instance from the yards to city hall to the water plant and back. They work very well for this, and they only need to be charged about once a week, which takes about four hours with 240-volt chargers, an added cost at two sites. The Leaf is cheaper to operate than a regular car. \nWe bought the Leafs with a federal grant, and they supplement our varied fleet, which includes hybrid Civics and Priuses, CNG-adapted pickups, and diesel hybrid transit buses. We'll learn more about lifetime cost of ownership and the right mix of vehicles for the fleet. Right now the Leafs look ideal for crosstown shuttling  between offices and to community events. Below are two links, to our fleet page and to a local news article on the Leafs which quotes Public Works staff and a supplier of rapid chargers. \nhttp://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=565 \nhttp://www.cvilletomorrow.org/news/article/13051-city_electric-vehicles/\n\n\nSince September, our city has had three Leafs (Leaves?).

Like to get you thoughts on its practical use, battery life, distance you are able to travel. Or if you have other electric vehicles, what was your criteria for selecting it?\nThanks.\n\n",
