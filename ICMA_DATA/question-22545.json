  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have criteria that you are or have used to define the quality of your parks and how do you use this to determine the level of maintenance needed to maintain that level of quality. \nBackground: In 2019 we laided off 12% of our public works department due to budget constraints. Since then we've been criticizedby a local garden club and sports groups for letting our parks fields, infrastructure and landscaping deteriorate. I have been asked to see if anyone has criteria or standards they use to determine the level of quality their parks impart to its users. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",
