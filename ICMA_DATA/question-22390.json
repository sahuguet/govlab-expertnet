In regards to 5Ks and 10Ks, this fee is applied to the start/finish line.\n\u2022   $21 Overnight closure per block for \u201chard\u201d street closures (discounted for nonprofits)\n\u2022   $350 refundable deposit\nThe difference between a hard closure and a soft closure is dependent on if vehicle traffic will be prohibited from entering the event area and the street is cordoned off with barricades (hard closure) or if vehicle traffic is temporarily held by a police officer, so that racers may pass through the intersection safely (soft closure).  Soft closures do not incur any cost to the event producer.\nWe ask that event producers pay for officer time.  Oftentimes, the police department is able to use grants to offset this cost and many nonprofits do not see a fee associated with pd time.  This rarely occurs with commercial events.  The cost incurred by other departments, when processing the application is absorbed in our day-to-day operations and is covered by the minimal \u201capplication fee\u201d, listed above.  \nFees for portable toilets and trash/recycling are the responsibility of the event producer.  A certificate of insurance, naming the City of Flagstaff as additional insured for one million in general, alcohol and/or auto liability is required and the fees incurred with getting the certificate is the responsibility of the event producer.\nAs for barricades, we adhere to the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices, a federally recognized standard for street closures.  It is the responsibility of the event producer to submit a \u201ctraffic control plan\u201d to be approved by our traffic engineer.  The cost of creating this document and implementing the barricades is the responsibility of the event producer.  Per the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices, the traffic control plan and all barricades must be implemented by a certified barricade company.  \nAs for scheduling events, we are limited as to the number of places to hold races and other street closures.  We cannot permit events to occur on streets governed by other agencies.  Many of our City streets are bisected by State streets or railroad crossings.  Our historic downtown is a popular venue for events, however many of the businesses do not feel that the events benefit their sales.  Some would argue that the events take away on-street parking and they see a decline in sales.  Because of this, our City Council has asked to approve street closures in the downtown area.  This allows businesses and residents the opportunity to voice support or concern regarding the street closure.   \nAs for limiting the number of events that can occur on a given day, we do not limit events.  We keep track of events in a recreation reservation system and do not overbook parks, facilities or streets.  It is not uncommon to have up to 10 events on a summer day around the Flagstaff area.

I am looking for some best practices on special event permitting and regulation on how many events  can be scheduled on any one day.  We currently only charge $15 per permit and no charge for all the traffic, police, fire etc.   Our Council has not been willing to charge due to the charitible nature of the events.   Thoughts, insights, and best practices would be much appreciated.\n\n",
