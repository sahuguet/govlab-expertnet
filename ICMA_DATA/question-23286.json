If you are talking about specific performance measures for a facility such as a building, how about using energy metrics like kbtu/square foot or energy cost/square foot to measure efficiency? If it's a high water user kgals or cost/sf could also be used. Hope this helps.\nDave Wortman, Brendle Group\nwww.brendlegroup.com\n\n\nIf you're talking about indicators/performance measures in general, IISD has a great searchable resource: http://www.iisd.org/measure/compendium/searchinitiatives.aspx.

We have a certain large county-owned facility that is requesting extra funds to operate and we are looking to incentivize those funds in the form of measures that could reduce overhead/operating costs. \nThanks everybody, in advance!\n\n",
