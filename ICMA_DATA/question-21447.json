What results have you seen?  Not translatable and cons?   Other focus or comments you want to share?  Thank you.\u201d   \nI would not recommend this or any other automatic translation programs for websites.  But I will admit, this translation is better than I anticipated and much better than the paid \u201cBrowse Aloud\u201d service that my previous employer used.

An automatic translator will sometimes pick the wrong word.\n\n\nOut of curiosity, I placed your question in Google Translate for Spanish.
