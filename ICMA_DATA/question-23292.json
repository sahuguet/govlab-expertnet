      "text": "\n\nHi Wayne,\nI've been casually following the reporting on the new ISO 37120, and I have a couple initial thoughts.  First, their list of things that cities should measure is heavy on the descriptors and outputs, but light on the outcome measures. Maybe as the standard evolves, the mix of measures will change--I hope so. I imagine just getting to this point was difficult for them.\nSecond, if I'm understanding correctly, the \"standard\" to be met is merely the reporting of a city's performance on the indicators. If you report your performance data, you've met the standard. ISO is making no judgement on a city's actual performance. That is probably by necessity because setting standards for actual performance on the indicators could be a real challenge, especially with a global mix of developed and developing cities.\nThanks for posting the question.\ndg\n\n\nHi Wayne,\n\nI've been casually following the reporting on the new ISO 37120, and I have a couple initial thoughts.

I am skeptical and was wondering if any jurisdictions are giving this ISO standard serious consideration in their performance management efforts. And if so, how and to what degree.\n\n",
