It is popular and successful.

      "text": "\n\nDowners Grove, Illinois, is a community of 50,000 with two code enforcement officers.  They each cover one of two districts and drive \"beats\" as police do looking for the the kinds of problems you mentioned.  They become very familiar with the good site,s the bad, and the ones oddly out of compliance.  We actually reduced our code officers from 5 to 2,and increased our responsiveness from 300 actions per year to 300 per month by switching to a beat approach.  Of course, we also respond to calls/complaints.  The code officers have laptops in their cars linked to the server and they can track progress by address.  Efficient and very cost effective. www.downers.us\n\n\nDowners Grove, Illinois, is a community of 50,000 with two code enforcement officers.

      "text": "\n\nOften times with code enforcement, you can get to 50 things but those other 50 that you never get notice of are the ones that catch the community's eye. At a previous location where I was, what we did was develop grids of various city areas, eventually encompassing the entire city in at least one grid. Then the \"blitzes\" would occur through each grid area for a period of two weeks where the assigned code officer would focus on that area and work each case he/she found. Of course, the regular job duties of addressing complaints were handled as well. This process worked really well and effects were more noticeable in each area and once all grids were completed, the process started over. We also gave the areas notice that we would in their area during a designated point of time so they were not paranoid of seeing the code officer repeatedly during a certain time.\n\n\nOften times with code enforcement, you can get to 50 things but those other 50 that you never get notice of are the ones that catch the community's eye.
