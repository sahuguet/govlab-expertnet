  "text": "\n\nThe City of Murrieta is currently exploring alternative options for fueling its fleet. City vehicles utilize unleaded and City fire apparatus utilize diesel fuel. \nCurrently, the City owns one above ground fuel storage tank (unleaded) and leases 4 others from an outside firm who also supplies fuel for the City. We are experiencing issues related to the maintenance of the leased storage tanks which is causing issues in our fuel reporting system. We would like to use this as an opportunity to explore alternative options relating to fuel supply, including:\n\u2022 Utilizing fleet cards \n\u2022 Purchasing our own storage tanks and bidding out fuel supply; and\n\u2022 Bidding/Contracting for new pumps/storage tanks and fuel supply.\nWe are interested in how other local governments manage fuel for their fleets. Please share your experiences (pros/cons) regarding any of the above options, any agreements, RFPs, and studies conducted that your City may have undertaken regarding the subject.  \nThank you for your time!\n\n",
