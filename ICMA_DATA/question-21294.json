However, the city manager works directly for the city council and whatever arragments are understood between the council and manger could allow the manager to not have t conform to city administrative policy.  Remember, legally and lacking any other controlling laws, the city manager makes and can modify administrative policy at will including making exceptions for themselves.  Example, a city policy that employees are not to use city computers for personal email.  The city manager may have to work very long days into the evenings and weekends and thus does not have the opportunity to go home and do their email.  Thus, they may use the city computer to keep up with things at home while at the office or while traveling on city business.  Also, the Manager may not have the ability to control who is sending them what to their office computer.  The manager could also make exceptions for Department Heads for similar reasons.  This would not negate the rest of the employees from complying.  Now if the policy is adopted by the city council, the manager would be obligated to comply unless the council policy gives the exception.\nHaving said that, I always believe it is good practice for the Manager to conform to the policies they adopt and expect others to comply, its about credibility not legality.\nHaving said that\n\n\nit most any legal construct and organizational structure, a city wide policy supersedes a department policy.
