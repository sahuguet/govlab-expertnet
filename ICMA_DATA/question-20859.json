      "text": "\n\nThe City of Tacoma currently uses SAP NetWeaver ESS (Employee Self Service) portal to give employees the ability to view paystub and change bank detail information, view vacation/PTO quota balances, log TRIP data and view benefit enrollments to name a few options through ESS.  An Information Technology project is currently underway to upgrade SAP to version ECC 6.04 this summer.  Along with this upgrade, Employee Self Service functionality will also be enhanced.  One example of how the improved functionality of ESS will add to the capabilities of SAP is Interactive Forms by Adobe.  With this application, the City will be able to reproduce familiar-looking interactive forms via the ESS portal.  Employees will have an easier time adopting new electronic distribution processes such as electronic pay advices.  If you would like guidance through existing functionality of SAP ESS, please contact John Ching (information below), and he would be happy to provide more information.  \nTo help employees understand the process, the Information Technology Department offers a 3 hr training class which briefly touches on capabilities of ESS functionality. Additional information will be provided to employees to help with the proposed changes to the system. \nContact information:\nJohn KW Ching\nJohn.ching@cityoftacoma.org\nPayroll Division\nFinance Department\nCity of Tacoma\n(253)591-5860\n\n\nThe City of Tacoma currently uses SAP NetWeaver ESS (Employee Self Service) portal to give employees the ability to view paystub and change bank detail information, view vacation/PTO quota balances, log TRIP data and view benefit enrollments to name a few options through ESS.

Do employees log-in to a central website and access their paystubs? Are they emailed to employees personal email addresses? Any info you can provide would be helpful. Thanks!\n\n",
