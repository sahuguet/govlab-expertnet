  "text": "\n\nI am looking for examples and/or information on donor drives as opposed to food drives.  Instead of asking for one-time contributions of food, volunteers (Neighborhood Coordinators) enlist their neighbors to become long-term Food Donors.  Each donor is provided a bag which is collected every 2 months.  This ensures a sustainable supply of food.\nAn example of what I'm looking for is the Ashland, OR Food Project:  http://www.ashlandfoodproject.com/\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\n",
