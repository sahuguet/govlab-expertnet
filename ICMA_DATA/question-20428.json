I agree the language in the legislation says that health benefits must be reported on a W-2 or a 1099 (memory is merky), but it doesn't say it is taxable income. The IRS is one of the responsible agencies for insuring compliance with the healthcare reform legislation. I think people are jumping to the conclusion it will become a taxable benefit.

It is probably all it is worth too!\n\n\nI don't think anybody has any credible knowledge on the healthcare reform legislation passed earlier this year.
