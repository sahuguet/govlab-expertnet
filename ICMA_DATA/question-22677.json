Our policy has been to not treat elected officials like employees with benefits.  Elected officials who volunteer their time for public service typically have careers or other means of income and since their service can be short-lived we have decided that resources (that cost the City) should be allocated to public services for our citizens and then for our public servant employees, rather than for Council members.\n\n\nThe City of Geneva IL provides only meeting stipends (and of course SS/Medicare as required by law).

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Naperville is interested in creative ways to compensate city council. The municipality currently compensates on average approximately $12,879.85 as gross income, and benefits such as life insurance, medicare, social security, IMRF, and health. \nHow do other municipalities in our outside of Illinois deal with Council compensation? Does anyone have any examples of packages or options available? \nAny input would be extremely helpful and beneficial! \nThank you,\nVeronica Kloff\nkloffv@naperville.il.us\n\n",
