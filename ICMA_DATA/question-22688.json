There are four lieutenants what supervise 14 patrol officers. One additional lt. supervises three detectives and a CSO who is responsible for evidence management. One additional lt. (designated as the admin. lt.) supervises the two traffic officers and the transport CSO (who moves people to and from jail and court). We have very limited parking at our City Hall so we have  a full take-home car program and each officer has a car. That would be 27 cars, both marked and unmarked, with a typical vehicle life of 7-8 years. The CSOs are both armed but have have a limited commission. They also do other duties like community events, parking enforcement, etc. There are 3.5 administrative support staff.\n\n\nTumwater, WA has a population of about 18,000.\nThere are 27 commissioned officers.
