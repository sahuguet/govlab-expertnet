I'm not sure how they have decided to rebuild (or not), but you might contact the City of Canton, GA (Melanie Whitt, Econ. Dev. Dir. 770.704.1520) and City of Fairburn, GA (Jim Williams, City Manager 770.964.2244).  You might also contact Athens-Clarke County, GA, just outside of the Atlanta region.  A historic theatre burned there last year and they've been working on restoration. Hope this helps!\n\n\nOddly, we've had a couple of historic downtowns affected by fires over the past year in the metro Atlanta region.

  "text": "\n\nWe recently experienced a fire in our historic downtown.  The brick fascade, roof and first floor survived.  We are now in the process of trying to determine the best plan forward.  Do we try to rebuild?  Should we demolish and start fresh?  We are looking for some best practices as well as advice about pitfalls.  If you have been through this type of experience, we would like to hear about what you learned and any words of wisdom about how to approach this type of problem.  Thank you very much.\n\n",
