  "text": "\n\nWe are trying to put together a scope of work for a study on the use of various alternative fuels. Currently, we have a small fleet of CNG vehicles and our own CNG station, but want to study other fuels to make sure continuing with CNG and possibly expanding our CNG fleet is the correct option. \nHas anyone put together a similar scope for a study? If so would you mind sharing that scope with us and also sharing who you chose to complete your study? Thank you in advance if you can respond.\n\n",
