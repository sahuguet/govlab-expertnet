  "text": "\n\nThe city is evaluating the possibility of bringing public safety dispatch in house and we are looking for guidance on where to start the process. Currently police and fire are dispatched by separate outside agencies under contractual arrangements. It would seem logical that if we are going to incur the cost of creating a dispatch center from scratch, it would be better to bring both agencies under \"one roof\" to handle dispatching.\nHas anyone done a recent cost benefit analysis on creating an emergency dispatch center to serve one or more of the public safety agencies? Any guidance in this area would be much appreciated.\n\n",
