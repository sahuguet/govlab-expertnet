They deal with requested variances, appeals for permits that have been denied, etc. They serve three year terms and meet on an as needed basis. One representative from Council sits on the ZBA as well as a representative from the Planning Commission. The other three are members of the public who have an interest in serving on the ZBA. Often they are former members of council or the planning commission who are still interested in serving on a limited basis.\nTim McLean\nAssistant to the Village Manager\nVillage of Jonesville, MI\n\n\nElaine,\nHere in Jonesville, we have a five member, Zoning Board of Appeals.

  "text": "\n\nLooking for information regarding the establishment of a \"Board of Appeals\" to provide the public with a final administrative review for appeals relating to a wide range of City determinations such as the granting, denial, suspension, or revocation of permits, licenses, etc.  \nSpecifically, how large is your board?  Who is it comprised of?  Civilians in certain trades? Staff?  At what point is your board engaged?  How often is it used?  How often has it overturned a previous ruling?  What is your board used for?\nAny information would be appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",
