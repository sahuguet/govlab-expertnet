Generally, local governments cannot directly use tax credits as they are not taxpaying entities.  A 3rd party power purchase agreement is commonly used so that tax benefits can be used when a system is installed on a local government.  There are also other ownership structures you might be able to use - but you would have to talk to a tax attorney about those.  Some states allow non-profits or government entities to take advantage of tax credits directly or by passing through benefits to an outside party.  There's state-by-state information on this in the DSIRE Solar Policy Comparison Tables: http://dsireusa.org/solar/comparisontables/\n\n\nMark - there are a few ways that local governments can utilize federal and state tax credits for PV.
