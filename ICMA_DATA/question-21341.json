  "text": "\n\nI'm wokring on a small project right now that involves identifying examples of when big city mayors have put improving governance and the use of perfromance measurement tools at the forefront of their agendas.  I am familiar with Mayor Bloombergs Simplicity initiative in NYC and Mayor (now Governor) O'Malley's CitiStat in Baltimore.  Please let me know of other examples that come to mind and if possible point me to articles, reports, and other publications with information.  \nPlease feel free to contact me at ebycer@sandiego.gov.  Thank you.\n\n",
