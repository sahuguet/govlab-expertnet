We developed a project scoring matrix with criteria, such as impact to the operating budget, estimated project life, frequency of use, etc.  This allows us to score each project to see how it ranks against other projects.\nOnce we have scored the projects, we develop the five-year plan.  Typically the higher-ranked projects are planned earlier in that time frame.  However, a project may be planned earlier if it has an outside funding source and we already have access to the funds, such as a grant, SPLOST, etc.  We strive to implement our CIP with pay-as-you-go financing, which for us, means our general fund can generally contribute about $1M each year to funding capital projects.  So, the project rankings, coupled with project cost and funding sources, are all considered when we develop the recommended CIP for Council to consider.\nThe document I've attached has an overview of our CIP process and policies, the scoring matrix we use, the scores we developed for our current CIP so you can get a feel for how it works, and the submittal form that department heads complete for their projects that we work from when scoring the projects.\nIt's a complex process so feel free to call or e-mail me with specific questions.\nJessica Roth, Assistant to City Manager\nCity of Suwanee, GA\njroth@suwanee.com\n770-945-8996\n\n\nWe (Suwanee, GA) do have a CIP review committee that includes our City Manager, Finance Director, and myself (Asst. to City Manager).

Some capital projects tend to be smaller in nature and are identified and funded through the annual budget process.  The proposed budget is submitted for analysis to the Office of Management and Budget by City Departments, which is reviewed and approved in-turn by the City Manager\u2019s Office and City Council.  The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) contains our larger infrastructure projects and is a single document which quantifies and focuses larger long- and short-range goals over a five-year time period.  The CIP is reviewed by our Capital Planning Team, which consists of managers from our departments who typically have these types of projects.  They identify potential conflicts in capital project plans; review and determine potential funding sources; and provide a collaborative network to stage and work multiple projects in a sequence that is mutually beneficial.  The CIP is reviewed and approved by the City Manager\u2019s Office, City Trusts and Commissions and City Council.\nMany of the large infrastructure projects are identified in advance of preparation for General Obligation Bond projects that are taken to the voters for approval.  Large projects are also identified in master plans that are reviewed and approved by City Council. Examples of these would be Parks, Water and Wastewater, and Police and Fire. \nWe define a capital asset as a new or rehabilitated physical asset that is non-recurring, has a useful life of more than three to five years, and has a cost greater than $7,500.  \nHere is a link to our current 5-Year CIP http://www.okc.gov/finance_tab/cip/Proposed_CIP_13-17.pdf\n\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City focuses both on a yearly capital project request process and a 5-Year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP).
