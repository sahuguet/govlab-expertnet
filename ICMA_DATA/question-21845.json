  ], 
  "text": "\n\nOur organization is hoping to undertake a strategic planning exercise to help position us to do business effectively for the next 10-20 years.  We are an extremely fast-growing city, and many of our current practices and philosophies that have served us well in the past are no longer sustainable.  \nWe have done lots of strategic planning with an external focus on the community, and we establish near-term organizational priorities every year.  What I am looking for are organizations with internal organization strategic plans, road maps or what have you, as well as learning about the processes used to establish those.\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
