  "text": "\n\nThe City of Phoenix, AZ has requested that the Consultants they regularly work with volunteer to participate in a 3% Fee Reduction Program as of June, 2010.  The 3% represents the pay cut city staff took in an effort to off-set the city's estimated $270 million shortfall in the budget.  Over 90 of the nearly 100 letters sent out have agreed to reduce their rates by 3%.\nI've heard other cities and counties have asked the vendors, trainers, consultants, suppliers, etc, they work with to take similar percentage reductions. I'd like to know if your agency has done something similar; if so, could I have a copy of the correspondence sent to vendors, trainers, consultants, suppliers, etc; and if known, the estimated savings.\nThe Alliance will prepare a newsletter article with the findings.  Thank you in advance!\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\n888-468-6450\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
