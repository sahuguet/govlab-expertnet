  "text": "\n\nGood Afternoon - Does anyone have a Request for Proposal, Request for Qualifications or an out right bid that they have successfully used for the purchase of amusement rides for a 4 day festival the Town will be hosting in August??  Part of the contract would be that a percentage of the ride tickets sold would go back to the Town as revenue.  Any other thoughts or ideas would be fantastic.   Bonnie Therrien,  Interim Town Manager, North Branford, CT     I can be reached at townmanager@townofnorthbranfordct.com\n\n",
