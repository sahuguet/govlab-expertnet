I've been with ICMA for a couple years now and think it is a great association. I'm currently participating in my third internship. This internship is at my local city hall in the city clerk's office. I aspire to become a city manager, or city clerk. Once I graduate in December, I shall be in search of a job in either of these offices as a deputy/assistant, or even in the full capacity of the office in a rural area. I highly enjoy working in government and hope to make a career out of it!\n\n\nGood afternoon! My name is Caleb and I'm a senior studying Public Administration.
