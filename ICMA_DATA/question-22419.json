  "text": "\n\nOur Information Technology department is looking to improve IT services provided to other City departments.  The first step is to formally define services through a Service Level Agreement.  This SLA will ensure valued IT services are delivered to achieveable targets that have been agreed upon with the departments.  Defining, establishing and measuring through  metrics is then key for reporting on the success of the service delivery.  How the departments are able to manage their desired services, and costs, is also important to cover in the SLA.\nOur IT department provides the standard computer services: Client Services (help desk, pc setup, software deployment), Application Services (application development, integrations to 3rd party software, gis support), and Technical Services (network configuration & admin, database support, server setup and admin).  \nWe are interested if your organization currently uses an SLA for the provision of IT services, and if so, would you be open to sharing this document with our IT Department.  Also of interest is how you capture and report on the metrics to support your SLA.\nYour input on how you approached the SLA would certainly assist us in improving our services and partnerships with our customers.\nThank you in advance for any SLA information you can provide,\nDan Anderson, GM of ICS\nCity of Medicine Hat\n\n",
