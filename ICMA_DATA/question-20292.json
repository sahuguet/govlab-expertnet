Currently we are at the stage of a hybrid system where we have full-time mixed with paid-on-call who sign up for part-time shifts to create full engine companies in station.  Our FT's work the typical 24 on, 48 off shifts while or POC/PT can sign up for full 24 hour shifts or just 8 hours at a time.  Call me if you need more detail, it is kind of complicated.\n\n\nToni, in Ankeny we have been through a long term progression from a paid-on-call department to a career/full-time department.

If so, it may make sense to look at a full-time, paid EMS service supplemented with a volunteer fire department.  As we all know, most fire calls are of an EMS nature.\nA combination paid/volunteer can be tricky, especially in a unionized environment.  Our department went directly from volunteer to paid (with a couple of volunteers from time to time) and is paid from general fund revenues.\n\n\nThe first question is why is the city considering a change?

I must say that the mixed departments always have management issues associated with the tensions between paid and volunteers both in professionals in command and procedures. Ultimately, I like having a fully paid department but the cost of such is absolutely extreme. To offset these expenses, my paid fire department provides BLS ambulance service and acts as our fire inspectors (100% employees certified as EMT and inspectors). Those functions bring in considerable revenue.\n\n\nI have been blessed and cursed to work in each type of system, all volunteer, mixed, and all professional firefighters.
