      "text": "\n\nHi Tad,\nA growing number of cities across the country are using online public comment forums that are linked to their Facebook and Twitter accounts to get citizen feedback in support of sustainability initiatives. \nThese online public comment forums have the order and decorum of conventional public hearings, so they are civil, First Amendment compliant, and meet public records law requirements. They're a nice complement to Facebook and Twitter in that those tools promote a city's request for feedback, and the online public comment forum keeps the feedback civil and legal.\nCheck-out some of the examples below, and let me know if you want more information and examples of this Web 2.0 solution.\nRegards,\nMike\nPeak Democracy Inc\n510-225-5336\nSalt Lake City UT:\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/79/Forum_221/Issue_517\nMontgomery OH:\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/42/Forum_74/Issue_189\nPalo Alto CA:\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/5/Forum_218/Issue_460?a=77\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/5/Forum_217/Issue_458?a=77\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/5/Forum_213/Issue_450?a=77\nhttp://www.peakdemocracy.com/portals/5/Forum_217/Issue_459?a=77\n\n\nHi Tad,\n\nA growing number of cities across the country are using online public comment forums that are linked to their Facebook and Twitter accounts to get citizen feedback in support of sustainability initiatives. \n\nThese online public comment forums have the order and decorum of conventional public hearings, so they are civil, First Amendment compliant, and meet public records law requirements.
