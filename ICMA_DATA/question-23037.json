Stormwater review on site plans is done by Lake County Water and Soil Conservation District.  Call me at 440-392-5802 if you have any questions.\n\n\nHi Brian:\nThe City of Painesville, Ohio (pop. 19,000) conducts site plan review in-house.

  "text": "\n\nHello,\nThe City of Oshkosh (pop. 68,000) is currently redesigning it's Site Plan Review process in attempt to make it more streamlined and customer friendly. If your organization currently has a Site Plan Review process, could you please take a minute and answer the questions below.\nThanks.\nBrian Chapman \nDo you have a formal Site Plan Review Process? If so, could you describe the process? \nWhat Departments are involved?\nHow many employees are involved with the Site Plan Review Process?\nDo you track or record process time, the number of submittals, and the number of re-submittals? If so, could you share your metrics? \nIs the Site Plan Review conducted in house or by a contractor?\nIs any aspect of the review contracted out? \nDo you have a self certification program or offer any education sessions for outside engineers, developers, etc?\nDo you use a customer service survey to gauge satisfaction levels from engineers, developers, etc? If so, how often do you conduct the survey? At the completion of a project, annually, etc. Could you please provide me with a copy of your survey?\n\n",
