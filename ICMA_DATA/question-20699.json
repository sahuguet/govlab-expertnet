Pittsburgh has outsourced the majority of it's fleet maintenance operations and city officials were curious as to how effective the policy was both in terms of saving money and maintaining a healthy fleet. The entire document is worth reading, but page seven of this report directly relates to how the outsourcing policy has affected preventative maintenance. \nhttp://bit.ly/eGCwOg\nThe second document is is a 2002 report from Mercury Associates, a fleet management consulting firm that focuses on core elements of fleet management that should NOT  be outsourced. One element that may relate to your question is performance monitoring and reporting. Regardless of whether your decide to outsource your preventative maintenance to a contractor, your city should still fill an oversight role in terms of observing and analyzing that work in order to keep the process in line with city expectations/goals. \nhttp://bit.ly/hZEZXO\nThe next one is a quick, two-page write up by AMECO, a private construction and general contracting company, outlining guidelines for when to outsource fleet maintenance. Of particular interest to your question is the following passage:\n\"An (in-house) mechanic is paid 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, or 2,080 hours. Excluding not-at-work time (vacation, sick, jury duty, outside training, holidays) and some non-productive time (coffee, bathroom, inside training), the available work time is 1,500 hours. If there is not 1,500 hours of work for the mechanic because of two few vehicles it is better to outsource repairs to a qualified organization\"\nFollowing that advice, it may mean that by outsourcing your preventative maintenance work to an outside organization you are reducing the necessity for a full-time in-house mechanic or mechanics to work on your fleet. If your fleet is relatively young, and thus performance maintenance more of a priority, it may be more cost effective to rely on an contractor to provide that work for you. \nhttp://bit.ly/eKO0n2\nHope this helps. Let me know if you need more examples and I can try to dig those up for you. Good luck!\n\n\nHi Christine,\n\nI was able to identify several documents that may be useful to you.\nThe first is a 2010 performance audit of fleet management and maintenance from the City of Pittsburgh's City Controller.
