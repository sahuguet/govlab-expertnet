  "text": "\n\nHello, I am an IT manager with the City of Las Vegas and am completing work on my doctoral degree in Organizational Leadership with a specialization in Information Systems and Technology. As part of the requirements for my dissertation, I am conducting a research study which focuses on the degree to which a relationship exists among leadership style, type of ERP implemented, and perceived ERP success in local US governments.  The results of the research study may be published but the identities of the participants will remain confidential. Your  name will not be disclosed to any outside party.\nThe following is the URL for the survey which will remain active through 7/31/10.  Your help is very much appreciated. A copy of the study will be shared with each participant upon request as results of the survey are completed.  http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R39XLMJ\nThanks!\nPatricia Dues, PMP\nEnterprise Program Manager\nCity of Las Vegas\n702-229-5433 Office\n\n",
