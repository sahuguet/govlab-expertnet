There's no doubt that recruitments are competitive, but strange things happen in recruitments that allow people of varying backgrounds and skill sets to shine through. I'm quite certain that you'll land something as you apply to a variety of city organizations. And, I completely understand that no one would want to start at the bottom as a budget anaylst after 17 years of managing a budget.\n\n\nHi Darin, I'm sorry that you haven't gotten more responses by now.

  "text": "\n\nI'm currently pursuing my MPA at the ripe old age of 40 and am looking to transition from my current career into municipal finance. I am currently in a senior position with a state university managing my office/department, a $1,000,000 budget and administering over $15,000,000 in grants. \n My question is simple; how can I transition into the municipal side of public employment without starting at the bottom? If my only choice is starting at the bottom, I'll stay in higher ed, where my 17 years actually mean something. Thanks in advance.\n\n",
