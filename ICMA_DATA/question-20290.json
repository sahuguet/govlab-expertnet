Lots of agencies don't agree with all the policies of Santa Monica, does the Council want those agencies adopting official boycotts against Santa Monica.  It is a bad precedent notwithstanding the purpose.\n\n\nI agree with Martha, our job is to carry out Council direction and Don gives good references.

Before this issue was even on the national radar, we were dealing with illegal immigrants and drugs every day and still are.  Our police were accused of racial profiling long before SB 1070 was crafted, but we were exonerated by the State AG.  Our city council recently took a stand against SB 1070, but not unanimously.  And on top of all that, we are a former mining community, now tourist town struggling to maintain services to the community like all of you.  Now I ask, why is it important to punish local communities with boycotts?  You may be making a statement against a state law, but you are punishing your colleagues who have the same daily challenges as you.

      "text": "\n\nHi Danielle:\nLooking specifically into one aspect of your question, there are many local governments around the country which have drafted the resolutions they passed to take immediate action, versus resolutions that call for specific policies enacting boycotts or other sanctions.  A common theme of direct action via resolution is that of prohibiting travel to Arizona by city employees, being enacted in such various local governments as the Cities of Boulder CO, Minneapolis MN, San Jose CA, New York NY, West Hollywood CA, and others.  Much less frequent are actual policies implementing boycotts, as the resolutions don\u2019t always set up a clear timetable for action, or are foregone based on the realization that a boycott will indeed hurt local governments and individual citizens more than actually gaining results.  Especially given the injunction recently instated by the Federal government against the more controversial aspects of the law, this approach has gained several adherents; among them are the Cities of Chicago IL, Durham NC, Portland OR, and others.\nAlso, I would like to respond to the third part of your question, based on what local governments have been doing.  Many cities interested in actually passing a boycott of goods and/or services from Arizona have been reticent to do so, upon considering the laws they have in place regarding city purchasing contracts (such as Portland OR).  Other cities have actually gone even farther in their response; San Francisco CA has even asked that major sports teams refuse to participate in league play scheduled to be held in Arizona.\nA few websites have maintained lists of cities which have replied with boycotts or in favor, and the specifics of their actions.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Santa Monica is looking for information to help us craft policy and practices in line with recent Council direction to \u201cplace in effect a boycott on Arizona businesses that would include, but not be limited to, suspending official city travel to the State of Arizona and directing staff to review current and likely future contracts to determine the feasibility of obtaining service from companies located elsewhere.\u201d\n1.Does your city/county have an official policy to boycott goods and services from Arizona-based companies in response to SB1070?\n2.Are there instances when an Arizona-based company would be exempt from the boycott?  For example, if the goods and services they provide are less than a specified dollar amount would their bid be considered?\n3.Does the boycott apply for existing contracts as well as new proposals and bids?\n4.What type of additional review, analysis, explanation, or justification is staff preparing  to support existing or proposed business with Arizona-based companies and for whom \u2013 Council, city management, finance department, others?\n\nAre there instances (in compliance with existing policy) where decisions related to Arizona-based companies can be made by city management rather than the Council?\n\nPlease send responses to jamie.malpede@smgov.net or contact (310) 901-7069.\nThanks.\n\n",
