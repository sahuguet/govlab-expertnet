  "text": "\n\nNew energy efficiency financing models have enormous potential to catalyze demand from both owners and lenders for clean-energy investment in buildings.  PACE financing is a model that would be administered by local governments and could allow property owners to undertake energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water efficiency projects without large up-front payments.  PACE \"districts\" would essentially be special taxing districts that would allow local governments to provide capital for energy and water improvements in buildings.  The outlay for projects is secured by a property lien and is repaid by the owner as a voluntary special assessment on the property tax bill over a 5- to 20-year term.  The General Assembly has approved enabling legislation for Virginia localities to consider such a program.  \nI am interested in hearing about localities (especially in Virginia) who are doing this or considering it for commercial only (not residential).\n\n",
