Also, Eastern Kentucky University and the City of Richmond, KY have done this. Here's a link from the ITGA Conference a few years ago. The panelists you might want to contact are under the \"Innovative Community Facility Development\" session. http://www.ucs.iastate.edu/mnet/itga/level2.html .\nInteresting topic you are working on. Please keep me informed on your progress. Thanks.\n\n\nHi Bradley,\nYou may know of this Canadian project http://www.fda-online.com/project_detail.php?id=360 .

With communities of artists, you get rich and nuanced networks that have big aggregate effects --a healthy scene --that can be hard to document and analyze, much less coordinate and plan centrally. Indeed the network's members may resist coordination. \nOur local arts council is working on a strategic plan for the arts, and university synergy is a big part of it. Hub site below. The Dreeszen consultancy may be a good resource for you, as may the arts & economic prosperity analysis. I'd love to keep on it, as your research might help our planning process.\nhttp://charlottesvillearts.org/createcville/\n\n\nThanks for the dissertation work; it is an important topic.

  "text": "\n\nICMA Community:  I am seeking examples of partnerships between local agencies and universities to support the performing arts.  If you have any personal experiences or community examples related to the performing arts (or even the arts in general) I would be deeply grateful.\nThe best example I can find is the San Luis Obispo Performing Arts Center Foundation (you can google it), but I am convinced there must be other well-documented success and failure stories out there.\nMuch literature has been published in the last decade about the rise of the creative class and its important contribution to vibrant cities with a strong economic base.  In an effort to enhance quality of life and thereby bring in more of the creative class, the performing arts can offer such a cultural contribution.  Since direct funding for the performing arts is scarce, partnering with universities makes sense for local government agencies.  I am looking for any information about such partnership attempts, whether in the form of blog posts, journal articles, personal experience with your own communities, etc.   All of this information will be used to advance the field of Town & Gown relations as I write my dissertation.\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
