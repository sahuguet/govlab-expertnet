      "text": "\n\nI applaud any government that wants to bring more professionalism to its operation.  I do want to call out one critical point, it is the Council/Manager Plan not the other way around.  This is becuase we recognize that the legilsative body reminas the focus of decision and policy making and the manager is there to serve the city council.  Also, that the executive branch never be represented as more important in the formula then the elected legislative body.  I know the order of the words seems to be a subtitle difference, but it is a critical difference to the profession.  Also, elected's get nervous about the \"power\" of the chief executive versus their power and putting the manager first can aggravate this existing concern.  Best of Luck.\n\n\nI applaud any government that wants to bring more professionalism to its operation.
