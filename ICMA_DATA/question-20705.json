  "text": "\n\nOur city participates once or twice a year in a statewide prescription drug turn-in event which has proven to be quite successful.  We are wondering if there are any cities or counties around the US that has developed a program that is available on a more frequent, routine basis?  If you know of such a program or have a program, we would love to hear from you.  We are interested in developing a program where citizens could drop-off their unused, unwanted prescription drugs here at City Hall on any workday.\nThank you in advance for your input!\n\n",
