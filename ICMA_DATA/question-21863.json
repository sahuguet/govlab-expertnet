The city uses a Management Agreement with a private golf course management company to run all aspects of the golf operation including the Pro and the pro shop.  the Agreement outlines the standards of performance required and we do a minimum of quarterly formal inspections for compliance and have regular monthly meetings to review issues by the city or by the operator.  We are very satisfied with this approach to the golf operation.  We feel we get much superior results from this approach than attempting to  operate the courses our selves.  Golf operations is their full time business where it would only be one of many services and operations of the city and would only be one of the operations.  These courses are a major revenue source and need full time, undivided attention which would not occur if the city were operating the courses.\n\n\nThe City of Indian Wells operates two 18 whole golf courses with a large club house.
