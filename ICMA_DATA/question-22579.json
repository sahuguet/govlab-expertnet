      "text": "\n\nAt Highland Park, IL we have adjusted the hours for PT employees to comply with the Affordable Health Care Act, effective on Jan 1, 2014. The total hours of a PT PW Maintenance Worker cannot exceed 1,500 hrs on an annual basis and cannot exceed 130 hrs a month (approximately). In addition, we have hired Seasonal PT Maintenance Workers to exceed the monthly stipulations. For example, a Snow Seasonal employee can work from Dec thru April with no restrictions on the number of hours. Come April we have to release the employee. And in Spring we hire Seasonal Summer PT hires to work on potholes and other Summer jobs.\nIt is a challenge and we are hopeful for meaningful amendments to the Act later in the Fall so that our PW Superintendents and Foremen can breath easy on coverage and scheduling issues especially during snow storms and flooding events!!\n\n\nAt Highland Park, IL we have adjusted the hours for PT employees to comply with the Affordable Health Care Act, effective on Jan 1, 2014.
