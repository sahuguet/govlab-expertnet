So you want to limit your search to compliant budgets. Fortunately, there are a lot. Second, you want to quickly figure out who is unique. To get there, you might contact those who see a lot of them: reviewers for the program. You can find the list here: http://www.gfoa.org/sites/default/files/u63/GFOAreviewersofbudgetdocumentsforthe2013calendaryear%284%29.pdf\nLook up email addresses at their jurisdictions' web sites and contact a few reviewers to see if they have any favorites to recommend. I've been reviewing budgets for a very long time but actually haven't seen much in terms of the departmental presentation to suggest -- but other reviewers might. Based on an earlier response you received, I looked at the City of Wichita document and it is really a nice approach to presenting departmental information -- good use of a standard format, embedded photos, and use of color to enhance the presentation and encourage a reader to actually read it! I like how they tie their performance measures to specific benchmarking organizations. \nI also looked at Loudoun's document. I typically review large counties' budgets, like your county, and I noticed that your document is lengthy -- about 425 pages in the departmental section alone. One consideration I would suggest would be to set an objective to shrink the detail and shorten the document. The current level of detail could be make available elsewhere on your website -- like at a department's own web site. Here is my rationale: if the document is too large, it will intimidate most potential users. An approach is to roll up to a higher level in the budget document and list key objectives and measures rather than drill down to the current level of detail. If you then apply a Wichita approach for an enhanced presentation, it doesn't have to be replicated for 425 pages. Feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.\n\n\nHere is an idea: You want to end up with something different but still complying with the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award Program criteria.

  "text": "\n\nI am working on a project for Loudoun County Government to find innovative and accessible ways of representing information within our budget documents while maintaining GFOA standards. I have seen examples from Walnut Creek, California and Arlington, Massachusetts. We currently present information via a narrative/table format and can be viewed here: http://www.loudoun.gov/index.aspx?NID=2857.  If you believe you have a unique way of presenting your information or know of another jurisdiction that does, please contact me at ben.carbajal@loudoun.gov. I appreciate your help!
