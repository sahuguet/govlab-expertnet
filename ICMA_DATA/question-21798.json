  "text": "\n\nWe are researching programs from smaller cities (under 1000 employees) for early and mid-level employees and managers to rotate through the City Manager's office for short periods of time or in alternating options where they still fulfill their position responsibilities.  We are seeking to develop programs for employees only, not outside recruitment of management interns.  Because of the downsizing most of us have seen, there is no capacity to have employees leave current positions and fully devote their time to a rotation.  If you have a program you have tried or put in place, I would be interested in learning more of the details and who to contact about it.  jerenewatson@flagstaffaz.gov; 928-213-2073.  Thanks!
