The City Manager lists the objectives and brief progress made in his staff meeting notes (called the project status report) every two weeks, which goes to Council.  Then every 6 months, I do a comprehensive report on the status, and we have a summary spreadsheet that specifies whether an objective is:  completed, on schedule, behind schedule, or on hold.  I have attached our most recent report as well as the spreadsheet.  Hope this helps.\n\n\nJohn, our Council develops a strategic plan and 2-year objectives every 2 years.

  "text": "\n\nWe are going through some strategic planning with our Council, and I am wondering if anyone has any great examples of reporting documents that could be used to report on the implentation of Council goals.  We currently use both an excell (gantt) chart to visually report on goal implementation progress, as well as a narrative Word document report.  However, we are looking to streamline these reporting documents or institute a better model.  Any help would be appreicated.  Thanks!\n\n",
