  "text": "\n\nI am looking for a good model ordinance for commercial overlay districts specifically outlining design standards.  We are a first ring suburb with a tansitioning regional commercial corridor.  The corridor has three distinct areas north to south - from denser smaller lots with more of a neighborhood feel, to a more traditional commerical area, to a suburban big box area.  Does anyone have something similar or know of communities with something similar.\nThanks!!\n\n",
