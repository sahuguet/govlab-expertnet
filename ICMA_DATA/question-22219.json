  "text": "\n\nSan Mateo County, CA is embarking on an endeavor to restructure our staffing model to ensure that it is both fiscally sustainable as well as agile enough to respond effectively to the pace of change.  Our focus is broad and includes examining different types of employee relationships, including fixed term, contract, temporary, volunteers, etc.  We would greatly appreciate your agency completing a brief, 5 minute survey to inform us about your organization\u2019s staffing practices and I will follow up directly with those that respond. \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/AgileWorkforce2012 \nThanks so much!\nDonna\nDonna J. Vaillancourt\nHuman Resources Director\n(650) 363-4132\ndvaillancourt@smcgov.org\n\n",
