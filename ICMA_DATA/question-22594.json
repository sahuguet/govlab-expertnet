If we want high morale, we need to include the workforce in day-to-day decisions that affect their work and their lives, including who they work with.  We need to keep them informed about what is going on.  We need to value their ideas and implement them.  We need to be clear about expectations and provide the means so that they can evaluate their own performance on a nearly daily basis, not a couple of times a year, when their \"superiors\" tell them how they are doing -- much better if they can figure it out for themselves.  They need to be involved in the development of their (units' and organizations') vision and how the work they do fits in and moves everyone forward.\nFor more information about the problem with \"Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise and Other Bribes\" see Alfie Kohn's 1993 book \"Punished by Rewards\"\n\n\nIf I may be so bold...I'd suggest that morale is not a product of 'band-aid' events or manipulative tactics to get people's commitment, but rather, the product of a long-term adult-adult, respectful and collaborative relationship.

      "text": "\n\nHi Toby and everyone interested in the topic of employee morale!  Gerry Brokaw challenged us a bit by suggesting that improving employee morale is not best accomplished by the occasional event or simple tactics or even compensation or giveaways.  The key message in Gerry's answer was that to really improve the way employees perform and feel about the workplace requires more of  a collaborative relationship than what the tactics/events approach can give us.  \nGerry was quite modest in his answer, but is a subject matter expert in this topic.  He recently did a webinar called the \"Science Behind Morale Issues\" with his partner from the Commonwealth Centers for High Performance Organizations, Phil Harnden. The webinar had great participations from local governments throughout the US and Canada and did a great job of exploring not only Gerry's approach to creating collaborative relationships in the workplace, but also the \"neuroscience\" behind how/why people engage or are fulfilled at work.  \nIf you are interested in viewing the webinar, it is available via ICMA's \"on demand\" services at the following linhttp://learning.icma.org/store/seminar/seminar.php?seminar=18761k , \nGerry is also a service provider through ICMA's Center for Management Strategies and also provides content for the CMS Blog and Group on the knowledge Network.  \nThe blog can be found at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/blogs/blog/50/Center_for_Management_Strategies\n and the Group (with its supporting documents on High Performance Organizations and other important organizational development work) can be found at http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/groups/kn/group/1302\nThese locations can be a great source of information on this as well as other leading practice topics in local government management, leadership and organizational development.

In my experience, when morale is addressed as an issue in and of itself, the results are less effective than when the underlying root causes are addressed.  Root causes may include organizational structure, management styles (e.g. micromanaging), job scoping (too limited/too broad), development opportunities, and methodology for performance appraisals (as Mr. Brokaw mentioned), just for starters.  Addressing these issues will go much farther in improving morale than incentives alone.\n\n\nI very much agree with Gerald Brokaw's posting.

  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for some great tips on non-compensation perks and morale boosters for city employees. What are you doing that helps with employee commitment and passion in your community? I know many of us are finally giving raises and/or cost of living increases again, but what else can we do to make our employees have a strong desire for their jobs in the municipal government? \n     It would be great if we could get many different ICMA members to post on this question. Maybe we can make this post the highest ever on the Knowledge Network. Information sharing of this type might give all of us a few extra ideas to make our employees just a little happier. Thank you!
