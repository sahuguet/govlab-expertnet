We met with departments and the main concern was the stipend is taxable.  We incorporated that into the the amount of the stipend.  I am happy to share all of our information with you.  My number is 734-794-6512 or you can email me.\n\n\nHi there!  The City of Ann Arbor rolled this out a few years ago.  We spent some time on the policy and a communication plan.

Upon department approval, managers and key personnel are reimbused $ 25.00 per month for cell usage and $50.00 per month if you have a data plan.  I will provide you a copy of the policy upon your request.\n\n\nSummit County recently revised their policy.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Livermore moved to a stipend about 18 months ago.  We provide varying levels of stipends, dependent upon anticipated usage.  There are phone only stipends (50 per month) and phone/data stipends (90 per month).\nWe really involved the employees in helping drafting the policy, and provided a lot of data as to the anticipated savings.  More importantly, we explained \"why\" early in the process. \nIt's a lot to describe in a posting, but i'd be more than happy to talk with you about the trials and tribulations of moving forward.  I can give you a copy of the policy and talk with you if you'd like.  I can be reached at 925.960.4000.  Good luck!\n\n\nThe City of Livermore moved to a stipend about 18 months ago.

      "text": "\n\nOur approach in Brentwood, Tennessee is similar for eligible employees: $40 a month for cell phones, $60 with data features.  What sold our employees on the change over about 4 years ago was that phone records for City owned phones are public records under state law in Tennessee. It eliminates the \"got you\" type articles directed at incidental personal calls being made by employee on City provided phones, etc. The additional taxable income was the trade-off but well worth it.\n\n\nOur approach in Brentwood, Tennessee is similar for eligible employees: $40 a month for cell phones, $60 with data features.

  "text": "\n\nI know that several localities have begun offering stipends to employees who use their own personal phones for City business, such as email, etc.  In my case, I gave up my City issued Blackberry and purchased my own I-Phone which has my City email account included.  For those who have gone in this direction, how did you move this idea forward?  What push back did you receive and how was it overcome?  Did you only allow those with localitiy issued phones who will willing to give those up to take advantage of this? How did you determine a stipend amount?\nThanks for your help!\n\n",
