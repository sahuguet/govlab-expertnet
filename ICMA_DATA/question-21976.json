Talk to your local truck dealers about possible used trucks.  2. Consider leased trucks.  3. Talk with your county or other municipalities about a used piece of equipment that could serve your needs until financial times get better.  Ask them to consider you as they replace equipment. 4. Speak with the DOT about the possibility of funding to purchase or equip a vehicle, possibly new technology that the DOT wants to try.  5.  You could also consider alternatives to doing your own snow plowing; you could contract.  Hope this helps.\n\n\nSeveral issues come to mind.

  "text": "\n\nOur Village is in dire need to replace its two dump trucks before the snow flies. Both are set up for plowing and dry deicer (salt) spreading. The one is literally falling apart. The other is beginning to have its share of high cost repairs and is actually too big for the Village.\nIs there a central resource from which we could locate fudning / grants to replace one or both of our trucks? With State cutbacks, lowered property values, and minimal license & fuel tax revenues, our options for self-financing are limited. We are the second largest community in Clermont County, Ohio , just a little under 5,000 population. I believe the county is considered part of Appalachia.\nThank you.\n\n",
