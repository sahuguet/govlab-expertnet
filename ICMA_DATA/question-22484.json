The first comes from Iowa State University's Center for Transportation Research and Education.  The report mentions several different designs and the impact on the directionality of snow movement during plowing:\nhttp://www.ctre.iastate.edu/research/conceptv/phase5/clear%20roads%20white%20paper.pdf\nThe second document is from the University of Wyoming's Department of Mechanical Engineering, as part of the National Research Council's Strategic Highway Research Program.  The paper features various flow analyses for different plow shapes and materials, as well as reports from field tests to complement the theoretical and experimental work.\nhttp://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp/SHRP-H-673.pdf\nHopefully these are helpful.\nGabe Brehm\nKnowledge Network Intern\nICMA\n\n\nHello Kevin,\n\nI've found some scientific and engineering reports that might help you understand the physics of snow plowing.
