A bit of information from our final report; the full report is at CRgov.com/2011survey.\nThe quantitative survey was distributed in a multi-modal approach that combined a survey link distributed via email, on the town\u2019s website and on postcards mailed to Town business owners. Hard copies were also available. The survey link was sent to 1,872 resident email addresses, and postcards advertising the link were sent to all 3,150 Castle Rock business license holders.

Of those, 1,086 were complete, non-duplicated, and usable responses, providing an overall response rate of approximately 25%.\n\n\nGregory, We also did an online survey this year.
