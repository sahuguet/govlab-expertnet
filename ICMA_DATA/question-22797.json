This organization assists governments with the work you are discussing which includes \"Vision to Performance\" work and \"Values to Culture\" work programs.  \nIn each,  it is not just a training program.  Valuable work products are produced including strategic plans, departmental operating/tactical  plans, and mechanisms to create a clear line of sight for employees at all levels of the organization to see how their work contributes to the accomplishment of the vision/mission of the organization (Vision to Performance. ) \nSimilarly, the Values to Culture work program assists local governments in articulating their leadership philosophy, identifying required behaviors and providing feedback to individuals, all with the goal of aligning experiences, beliefs and actions by all of the governmental staff to meet the expressed values of the organization to create the desired work culture.\nThis is very interesting work that truly provides an tool for driving the \"vision\" as well as the \"values\" into the entire organization, hence creating higher levels of performance.

      "text": "\n\nGreg, the City of Tamarac made a conscious effort several years ago to further deploy our vision, mission, and values to all employees.  We did several things: we involved all employees in setting our vision by asking every employee \"where do you see the City in 5-10 years\"; we had \"visiting department director meetings\" for directors to visit other departments and talk about our vision, mission, and values; we began involving all employees in our strategic planning process each year; we post our mission, vision, and values throughout the City; and we also created what we call a tri-fold card that employees fill out and keep with their work IDs.  The tri-fold card has our vision, mission, and values on it, but it also has a place for employees to write in how their job links to the City's strategic goals and their department scorecards.  We also continually reference the vision, mission and values when talking with employees, and they are aligned with our budget and strategic planning processes.  The good news is that the number of employees who responded that they \"know they City's mission, vision, and values\" in our employee survey has improved from 79% in 2007 to 90% in 2013.  I included a copy of the back of our tri-fold card below, but if you have any questions please feel free to give me a call at 954-597-3518.
