  "text": "\n\nThe City of North Port, Florida is working on a social media policy. Specifically, I'd like to know how Florida cities and counties are capturing public records when it comes to social media tools like Facebook and Twitter.\nI've heard that you can take \"print screen\" screen shots of your web page and save the activity that way. Is there a more effective way to capture the information?\nPlease let me know by sending me an e-mail at ebryce@cityofnorthport.com. Thank you for your help.\n\n",
