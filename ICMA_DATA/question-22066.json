As a standalone application, Class has done a decent job of meeting our needs -- the path to a hosted application is less clear, though.  While I am not fully involved in discussions about functionality, some early indications were that migrating existing data to a hosted solution were going to be difficult if not impossible.  \nOne other vendor to look at is Energov Solutions.  While they are not currently marketing a recreation management suite, they were a vendor at the Washington Recreation & Park Association annual conference and trade show in May.   Contact Rob Della Marna, 888-355-1093 x3139.\nFinally, another system that has caught my attention in the past is Daxko (daxko.com).  This system is used by the local YMCA for program registration and member management, and their website makes it sound like they may be a preferred provider for the YMCA.  I'm not sure what their overall functionality is, particularly on the POS and facility reservation side, but they may also be an option to explore.  I seem to remember that this system also had some type of background check mechanism integrated directly with the membership module.\nGood luck!\n\n\nWe use Class (sold by Active Networks) for these functions; however, it is my understanding that the standalone app is going to be phased out over the coming years and all existing users shifted to a hosted solution.
