  "text": "\n\nA Knowledge Network member is wondering: \nWith limited resources and time to track absenteeism, I\u2019m very interested in knowing if anyone has recommendations for the types of absenteeism that should be most carefully tracked to best evaluate the health of an organization \u2013 scheduled absences (vacation, personal time off), unscheduled absences (sick days, disability, FMLA, Worker\u2019s COMP) and partial shift absences (arriving to work late, leaving early, longer breaks).\nIf you have any advice for this member or relevant policies please post them below. \nThank you, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n",
