The people, culture, and work are all excellent.

Check out NeoGov as well - many cities subscribe to this service for job posting.\nDitto what Brian said.  Look outside the box at cities, counties, and special districts.  Also, be patient!  I've seen so many people anxious to get high-ranking titles right out of grad school.  In this economy, that's not realistic.  I had to work over 10 years up through the ranks, starting as a customer service rep for a city water billing department, before I was able to become a management analyst and finally an assistant to the CM.  It might sound old-fashioned, but you do have to pay your dues.  Plus, you learn a lot by doing the \"grunt\" work.\nGood luck and have fun!\n\n\nCheck out the ICMA website and local government associations in individual states (I'm familiar with the League of California Cities and the Association of Washington Cities).

Also check with your alumni network for people in the profession.  If your finances allow you to join a state or national professional association that is a good resume booster that shows you are serious about your profession.\n\n\nDitto to Brian's and Alex's comments.

I worked my tail off and demonstrated what I could bring to the dept and 3 months into doing that, they offered me a full-time position as an Analyst.  Ironically, I am down to ground zero again after facing lay-offs last December from being a Program Manager.  However, I am volunteering in a CM's office and getting valubel work done and keeping my resume updated while I continue to look for work.  Don't let the economic climate be a hinderence to your search.  Do anything anywhere and you never know what it will bring you.  Networking with your alumni orgnization is indeed a great tool, as was indicated.  Good luck to you.\n\n\nDitto to all the points given above.

At present, I have been going to local municipalities websites to look for open positions.  Are there resources that anyone can recommend that I should check out?  I am currently in Arizona but would have no problem with relocating.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much!\n\n",
