  "text": "\n\nGood Afternoon,\nI am a member of a Leadership Development program at the City of Englewood, CO and my group has been tasked with exploring partnerships and the value it may or may not have for the community and organization.\nIn the research that we have conducted many entities first developed an extensive strategic plan and performance measures prior to exploring partnerships (public-public, public-private, regional) for their communities.\nWould you be able to tell me what challenges your organization faced during the development process of a strategic plan?  How the strategic plan has helped your organization in the decision making process? How have performance measures have helped (or not) in managing internal performance as well as contracted services and have performance metrics helped to identify potential areas where partnerships could occur.\nThank you in advance for you assistance.\nVince Vega\n\n",
