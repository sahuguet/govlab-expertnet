  "text": "\n\nI am interested in hearing about any ordinances that local governments have regarding broken windows. We are considering passing an ordinance on this issue that is similar to the International Property Maintenance Code. So I would like to hear if any communities have an ordinance that deals strictly with broken windows. Because blight ordinances are difficult to enforce, I am trying to stay away from that terminology. Any information would be extremely helpful.\n\n",
