  "text": "\n\nThis is a very simple question. What is the leash law length for dogs in your community? Our City code states:\n\"While it is restrained by a leash of not more than six feet in length and of sufficient strength to control its actions and is accompanied by a person of sufficient strength to control the dog.\" At our last City Council meeting, as part of a comprehensive review of our animal codes, the Council debated the merits of increasing the leash length from 6 to 8 feet. Another council member thought it should not be limited. What is the allowed length of the leash in your community? Thank you!\n\n",
