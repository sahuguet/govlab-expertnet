  "text": "\n\nI am reviewing educational incentive programs that other municipalities have in place. Specifically, I would like to know if you offer any monetary incentive for employees who have earned a degree; does the degree have to be in the field that they are currently assigned i.e., a police officer with a criminal justice degree vs a police officer with a recreation management degree; what is the incentive, i.e. lump sum, percentage of current salary; do you offer higher incentives for higher degrees; and is the program available to all employees or only certain departments.\nFor those that do have a policy in place, I would like to get a copy if possible, which can be done off line.\n\n",
