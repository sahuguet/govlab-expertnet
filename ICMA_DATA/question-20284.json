One of the things I have done with laid off firefighters is to offer them first call on department overtime.  With today's constant manning this could be almost full time work.  this kept them with income and reduced the risk of losing trained and developed personnel to another department.  You will get complaints from the remaining firefighters losing the huge overtime checks they are used to getting.  I felt and feel it is the fair and right thing to do.  If you prorate the benefits, you could save even greater costs.\n\n\nI have not switched back to 12's.  I have been through five recessions.

      "text": "\n\nThere are several things to keep in mind when looking at a move from 24 hour shifts to a 12 hour shift. \nThe 24 hour shift is predicated on the ability for firefighters to rest or sleep while on duty but, in exchange, the work week is lengthened to as much as 56 hours of \"straight pay\" before overtime results.  A 12 hour shift results in no rest time but the question that occurs is \"what do you do with the added hours?\"  The 12 hour will allow you to adjust staffing to meet demand; is this allowed within the framework of your contract? Departments that have minimum manning and minimum staffing may see no savings because of the inability to adjust the numbers of personnel on duty. \nAs Richard Brown stated, a 24 hour shift utilizes (normally) three squads or platoons while a 12 hour requires four.  Other factors that may influence costs include how sick and vacation pay is determined (days or hours), the use of \"Kelly Days\", and when training can be conducted (some departments prohibit training on weekends and after 5 p.m. by contract).\n\n\nThere are several things to keep in mind when looking at a move from 24 hour shifts to a 12 hour shift. \n\nThe 24 hour shift is predicated on the ability for firefighters to rest or sleep while on duty but, in exchange, the work week is lengthened to as much as 56 hours of \"straight pay\" before overtime results.
