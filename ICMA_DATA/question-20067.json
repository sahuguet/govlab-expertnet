If so, it's a very arduous process and my best advice would be to get some intensive training for yourself and key staff.  As for lessons learned, I'm chairman of the Bristol CT Housing Authority and we're working on rehabing 90 units of low/moderate income family housing, and it quickly became apparent that the funding process for public housing projects is very fluid, very political, and very complex.  A bad consultant can really rake you over the coals by constantly presenting new obstacles (each with a fat price tag attached).  I recommend making it mandatory for any proposals to include a detailed plan of how th eproject will proceed, and require an amended plan (with cost estimates for EACH step) anytime anything changes.  Otherwise the bills can just keep coming.  If the funding is squared away and you're just looking for a developer, my only advice would be to place a lot of weight on experience doing similar projects in your state.  You don't want someone who doesn't know the ropes, since there's a lot of red tape with these projects.  Also, be sure you have some worst-case pro-formas written up in case some costs run a bit higher than planned (which pretty much always happens).  Make sure the project is viable even if luck isn't on your side.  And if the press wants to know when you'll be done, double any project duration estimates you receive from the developers or consultants and you have somewhat less of a chance of coming in late.  ;)\n\n\nAre you financing it through Low Income Housing Tax Credits?
