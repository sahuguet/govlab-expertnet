Try to find an internship or part-time opportunity that you can accomplish while you continuing working. \nThere are many examples of people who have made the transition from a department leader (not just Police) to the City Manager's Office.

The Jackson County Sheriff's Department needed some administrative help, especially writing a major traffic safety grant. I worked for them part-time as a civilian Administrative Assistant, while continuing at the Police Department. That helped to demonstrate my abilities. I then left the Police Department to take a job as civilian Administrative Assistant to the Chief of Police in Skokie, Illinois. After doing that job for two years I was promoted into the City Manager's Office. \nI have been the City Manager in Dubuque, Iowa for 20 years. Call me if you want to visit (563-589-4110).\nMike\n\n\nJohn,\n\nThe answer is yes, but you will still need to demonstrate that fact.
