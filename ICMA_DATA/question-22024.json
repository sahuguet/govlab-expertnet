      "text": "\n\nThe City of Tamarac has a couple of tools we use specifically to engage our employees in the Strategic Planning Process.  \nAt the start of our Strategic Planning Process we utilize our mid level managers to conduct department level SWOT analyses for each of our 5 strategic goals as a way to involve employees at all levels in our Strategic Planning Process.  We then use an established quarterly meeting of those mid level managers as a forum for a group exercise to roll the department SWOTS up to a city-wide SWOT for each goal and develop preliminary action items to address some of the issues.  This \"pre-work\" carries over to the Executive Strategic Planning Retreat and has the benefit of both prioritizing the SWOTS as well as ensuring employees contribute to the process.   The completed strategic plan is a 4 page document that goes to all employees - so it is a living, breathing document that employees can refer to and understand.\nWe also utilize a tool we call a \"Tri-Fold card\" which is made up of 3 panels that fold to fit in an employee's badge holder.  The panels state our mission, vision, values, and strategic goals - but they also have a blank panel for employees to write in how their job ties to the City's strategic goals.  We hand them out to all employees and then utilize a team of employees to ask to see them (and guide them on how their job ties in if they need assistance) - employee names who filled out their card get entered into a city-wide drawing for gift certificates and we are at nearly 100% participation.  The cards have become a part of our culture - we just updated them for the third time as two of our strategic goals changed last year.\nThrough the use of these tools we have seen our employee survey scores increase over the years - specifically those questions that that address knowing the mission, vision, values and strategic direction of the City.\n\n\nThe City of Tamarac has a couple of tools we use specifically to engage our employees in the Strategic Planning Process.  \n\nAt the start of our Strategic Planning Process we utilize our mid level managers to conduct department level SWOT analyses for each of our 5 strategic goals as a way to involve employees at all levels in our Strategic Planning Process.
