  "text": "\n\nI have a member who estimated the bill for several of their customers this year due to frozen pipes.  Recently they have done a true up and have several customers who owe a large amount of money. They are looking for some sample language that they could use to send to the customers that would enable them to pay the extra amount over a set time period.  Any assistance would be welcome.  We are located in the State of Iowa.\nThank you.\n\n",
