  "text": "\n\nAssessing some different methods of compensating management staff (unrepresented personnel, such as Department Heads, Directors, etc direct reports to Administrator) in our county. \nYears past we have done the basic, \"3% across-the-board\" type increases.  \nI would like to get into less \"general\" of an increase, tying compensation to organizational or departmental performance.  I have reviewed some balanced scorecard examples which include a multitude of factors combined to arrive at a performance-based pay increase and these seem to be progressive and practical. \nLooking for best practices and examples of policies/plans that incorporate novel strategies to compensate management staff. \nThanks in advance.\n\n",
