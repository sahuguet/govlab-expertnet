All of these costs are reimbursable in a disaster declaration but a detailed report will be required.

If you didn't do it during the response, put out the word to have those individuals come in (or by email) and write down their hours.

Keep in mind, however, that my experience with FEMA and disasters is from a town/city perspective, so your experiences may differ somewhat being in a county.  Also, I do not know the level of the declaration or how bad the damage is where you are (though I have seen some on the news), so the intensity you experience may vary.  \nI just went through a major disaster with Hurricane Irene last year.  The whole region sustained major damage.   Once the declaration was made, I literally had about 50-75 emails a day regarding the disaster for almost two weeks (and most of it was needed/official and detailed correspondence), not to mention phone calls and personal meetings with sustained workdays lasting on average of about 12-14 hours.  However, some years ago, I experienced a declaration for a smaller, much more controllable event, so the intensity was not that demanding.  Regardless, the requirement to document everything in detail and then be able to translate/transcribe that information into the form that FEMA and the other agencies required was the same.   And indeed this brings me to my first major point:\nDocument, document, document all damage, in picture and written form where possible, and costs (as Mr.  Wieczorek details in his 2nd paragraph).\nAnother area I would caution you on is to know and follow FEMA\u2019s procurement and bidding guidelines.  They are really quite standard and should not be a problem for you since you are in a county, which usually have at least standard procedures in place; however, I have seen some smaller communities that are accustomed to using less formal procedures have trouble getting reimbursed.  Usually the rules, however, do not go into effect until a short period after the declaration.  Check with FEMA/local emergency management agency if in doubt.\nBe prepared to have to deal with numerous FEMA (and other) officials and for the onslaught of information via all sources (calls, email, and visits).  Also, be diligent to pursue them as well about programs that are available, or even needs you have that may not be mentioned.   \nIf this is your first dealing with a disaster declaration, be prepared to have to learn a lot of terminology, rules, and regulations (mostly from FEMA); it will benefit your communities and county if you know as much as possible as soon as possible, however, and prepare you for all the administrative reporting and requesting to come.   FEMA has much of the basic/generic information on their website if you want to get a jump on it.

It all depends on the type of disaster that has been declared (there are different types) and the determination of which Cadres will be deployed.  Assuming there has been a major disaster declaration made for the county by the President then the three of the key ones are IA-Individual Assistance, PA-Public Assistance, and VAL (Volunteer Agency Liaison).  FEMA does not have assistance for businesses so IA is dedicated to homeowners.  SBA partners with FEMA in such disaster declarations and is the focal point for assisting affected businesses.  IA, PA, and VAL will be based in the JFO (Joint Field Operations center) with VAL being an invaluable point of contact both for national or out of region nonprofits bringing resources into the area as well as local nonprofits.  Local government leadership and managers best serve disaster response by making sure those connections are made with IA, PA, and VAL.  PA is primarily funding assistance for repair and replacement of damaged public infrastructure.   Many of the other steps identified by others are important too with the foremost being for local governments to gather as  much information as possible on the disaster impact.  Once you have a chance to catch your breath and the first few weeks have passed, I would also urge you to read through the National Disaster Recovery Framework which became federal policy for disaster response as of mid-2011 and now governs response.\nGood luck...\n\n\nYour question to what to do in week 1 is to first not get overwhelmed by all the different FEMA Cadres all of which are designed to be component elements of a comprehensive delivery of post disaster services.
