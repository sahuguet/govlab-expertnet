Instead of a position of event production, I am researching a position of event recruitment (and coordination of private event producers solicited/recruited to produce their event in our city) in an effort to increase the number of event days at our venues.  Do you have a job description, contract, pay package/scale, evaluation tool or any other information that would be helpful?\n\n",
