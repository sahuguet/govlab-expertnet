Unfortunately we do not have any literature yet about local governments adopting ITIL guidance and practices as it is usually used in private enterprise, although it is the standard there. \nHere is a link to ITIL\u2019s website which has many very useful papers offering guidance and advice on how to make sure your adoption and usage is a success http://www.itil.org/en/vomkennen/itil/index.php ITIL has been around for over 20 years so there is a wealth of knowledge on their website.\nI hope this helps answer your question, and any members with experience please chime in and share your thoughts on this set of IT practices\nBest,\n Robin Saywitz\nKnowledge Network Intern, ICMA\nrsaywtiz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Wydale, \nThank you for the interesting IT question!
