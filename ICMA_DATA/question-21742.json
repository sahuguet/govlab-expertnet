  "text": "\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew of any cities or towns across the country that have mandated a fairly large-scale push to convert heating oil to natural gas, and have done so using a revolving loan fund set up by that municipality, not any kind of state created RLF. It can be any kind of loan fund, but it has to be set up by that town. And by large scale I mean at least a city-wide for all city-owned buildings, but the more the better.\nThank you\n\n",
