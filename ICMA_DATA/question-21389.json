  "text": "\n\nI had posted a query a couple of days ago.  I would like to add to the question posted previously which is  stated below:  \nThe City of Virginia Beach is seeking information on how other localities are managing their assets. Types of assets included in this research are:\n\u2022   Electrical and mechanical equipment (e.g., HVAC systems)\n\u2022   Building components (e.g., roofs)\n\u2022   Technology (e.g., network equipment, servers)\n\u2022   Parks and Recreation Equipment (e.g., boilers, air compressors)\n\u2022   Fire station equipment (e.g., refrigerators, stoves)\n\u2022   Generators\nVirginia Beach currently manages the types of assets listed above by functional area. For example, Public Works manages the building assets, the Technology Department manages all technology, Parks and Recreation manages parks assets, etc.\nWe are not including the following in this study:\n\u2022   The building structures themselves\n\u2022   Water and sewer infrastructure\n\u2022   Storm water infrastructure\n\u2022   Roadways\nOur question:  Does your locality manage your assets by functional area or by collecting asset data in one place so you can manage those assets more comprehensively?\nAn additional question follows:  \n\"Does your locality have an asset management plan that includes such things as major equipment, building systems, parks equipment, and/or trails?\"\nIf so, may we please have a copy and if at all possible as soon as possible.  Please send to: \nLee Hedlund Senior Management and Budget Analyst\nDepartment of Management Services\nVirginia Beach, VA  23456\nPh. 757-385-8388\nFax 757-385-1857\nlhedberg@vbgov.com\nMany many thanks in advance.\n\n",
