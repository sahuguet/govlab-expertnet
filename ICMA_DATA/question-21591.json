In contrast, Alexandra's response seems to focus on case studies and apps in which citizens (not gov staff) reply to issues raised by gov leaders. Moreover, in reading through the links that Alexandra posted, few if any of the articles addressed the substantive challenges that gov leaders face when using social media to engage the public in 2-way conversations. These challenges include (1) civility and fairness expectation of the community, (2) legal requirements for governments, and (3) what I call the \"Referendum Effect\".
