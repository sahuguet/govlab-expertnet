In January of this year The Alliance For Innovation posted \"8 Emergency Notification Resolutions\" for 2011. It  consists of 8 easily adaptable recommendations for improving your ENS. Each suggestion is brief and general in nature, but the tips they offer may be helpful to communities that are unsatisfied with their ENS practices as currently constructed.  \nhttp://transformgov.org/en/BlogPost/124/8_Emergency_Notification_System_Resolutions \nUp next is a 2005 article written by Mike Curry, the Emergency Management Director for Jackson County, Oregon. In the wake of the Sept. 11th attacks and widespread fires in 2002, Jackson County extensively updated their ENS operations to meet these new threats in the future. Listed at the bottom of the article is Mike's contact information, though since the piece was written in 2005 I don't know how current it is. \nhttp://icma.org/en/Article/10480/Homeland_Security_Fires_Up_Oregon_Counties_to_Enhance_Emergency_Notification\nAlso, I have attached to this answer a report by ATIS on best practices for ENS call volume testing. A little narrow I know, but the last two pages offer logistical and maintenance advice that can be broadly applied to your ENS system in general.   \nI hope this is enough to at least get you started in your search. I'll be on the lookout for any communities or individuals that have distinguished themselves in the realm of ENS. If I find any I will be sure to send them your way. Good luck.  \nDerek Johnson\n\n\nHi Genevieve,  \n\nUltimately, I think you would be best served by speaking with someone directly involved in their local ENS operation, as they could no doubt answer any specific questions you may have.  \n\nIn the meantime, I was able to identify several resources that may be useful to you in your search for additional illumination.
