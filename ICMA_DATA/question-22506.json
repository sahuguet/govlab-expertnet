Educating the business owners on the value of having the most proximate parking spaces for their customers works, but it can be difficult.  Have you considered time limits or ordinances requiring employees to park in the remote areas? \nDo you currently have paid parking in any area? Meters? \nUnfortunately there is no simple answer and the best scenario is probably a mixture of paid parking, time limits and incentives. \nFeel free to contact me if you want to chat about this more.\n\n\nFrank- The incentives are the \"carrot\" and most times you need some \"stick\" to get the results you want when it comes to getting people to park in the right place.

  "text": "\n\nOur community, Estes Park Colorado, is a destination resort in the Colorado mountains.  Our visitation populations soars in the summertime and parking is a major issue.  Part of the issue comes from employees of businesses downtown, and town employees (Town Hall is in the core downtown) parking when they come to work.   We have remote parking areas available.\nI'd like to hear from any communities that have had success with incentive programs to encourage folks to use alternative transportation or to park in more remote areas, so the prime parking spaces in the downtown area are available for shoppers and visitors.\nFrank Lancaster\nEstes Park Colorado\n\n",
