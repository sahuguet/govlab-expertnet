So if you intend to plan and conduct training sessions, perhaps that's the audience that should be targeted, with the understanding that one of the supervisors' basic responsibilities is to clearly communicate and reinforce policy changes to their direct reports.  Good luck.\n\n\nWhile we don't have any policies or procedures to share, in thinking about the question, I suggest that an effective policy would need to recognize and place appropriate responisbility with managers/supervisors to understand and communicate the impact of changes to organizational policies.

We're updating our policy and procedure manual and would like to have some sort of procedure on how to make sure everyone is made aware of changes/new policies.  (i.e. distributing pages to replace in manual and have employees sign off, training session going over new policies as they are adopted, etc)\nDo you have a standard/formal procedure in place to educate staff about new policies?\nIf so, please advise.  If possible, attach a document outlining the procedure taken.\nthank you in advance!\n\n",
