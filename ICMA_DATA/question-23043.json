Cities have used these types of special events as professional development for up and coming members of the management team from within the various city departments.  It\u2019s a learning experience for the employee on how to develop, manage a budget, committee work and all within an appropriate time frame.    I am interested what a city would provide the selected employee to accomplish the special project or event.\n\n",
