Specifically we are trying to learn how common this is and what problems it creates. Further, who does the chief actually report to on a day to day basis? Any information you can offer will be helpful to our research.\nIf you want to avoid a public posting of the issues you encounter, please email me directly or call me. Thanks\nLeonard A.
