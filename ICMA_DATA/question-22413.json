  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have any successful initiatives to address or encourage private investment in existing hotels? The City has several hotels, most of which are low quality and aging. The property owners have elected to invest the bare minimum into the hotels. This leads to a low number of overnight stays in these facilities. The City is currently seeking to recruit a new hotel to the community to address the low quality hotel rooms, but I see an opportunity to revitalize the existing stock. \nAll but one of the hotels are located in a Neighborhood Revitalization District that allows the incremental increase in property taxes to be reimbursed for a ten-year period. This has not been enough the promote the type of investment that is needed to make the hotels attractive to most travelers.\nAny ideas would be most appreciated.\nThanks.\n\n",
