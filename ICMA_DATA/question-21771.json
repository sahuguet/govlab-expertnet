Unfortunately, because of the miniscule number of people who actually serve in the military today I am not expecting much of a response at all.  According to the Department of Defense, \"Just one-half of 1 percent of Americans served in uniform at any given time during the past decade -- the longest period of sustained conflict in the country\u2019s history -- the report says. Meanwhile, as the military shrinks in size, the connections between military members and the broader civilian population \u201cappear to be growing more distant,\u201d the report says.\" Sadly, the odds of having in a vet in your workforce grow increasingly smaller. \nHaving said that, I would speculate that vets ARE more likely to seek employment in the public sector, so the odds of a vet being employed by the local government are probably a bit higher than other career fields. I would hope that they are approached just like every other employee, unless circumstances (such as a disability)dictate otherwise.\nThanks!\nDenis\nSource cited: http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=66253\n\n\nHello Wayne- as an OEF vet myself, I am very interested in the response to this question.

      "text": "\n\nI agree with Denis that vets are more likely to seek municipal employment, and I would add that municipal employees are more likely to be vets, reservists, or Guard. But I see more potential than problems.\nMore than 0.5% of our (rural Virginia) job applicants are recent veterans, and especially in public works and public safety. We don't have any explicit vets preferences, but the number of veterans in our management affords understanding.  Most returning vets understand how to explain their skills and experience in civilian terms: skills in machinery, computers, supervision, and high-stress situations are impressive. Veterans often appear well qualified, and we have hired several. \nThis wave of well trained and proven veterans coming home can make great contributions to civilian service.\n\n\nI agree with Denis that vets are more likely to seek municipal employment, and I would add that municipal employees are more likely to be vets, reservists, or Guard.
