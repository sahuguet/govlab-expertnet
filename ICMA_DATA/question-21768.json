      "text": "\n\nHi Sarah,\nThis is a good question.  I have done a little research into PM software, and have yet to find anything truly inspiring.  I do agree with Robert that Excel is probably a great solution.  Someone recently reminded me of the saying that we only use about 5% of our brain - an apt metaphor for Excel.  Excel is quite capable, and everyone already has it.  I suggest, if you have the time, spend some time learning some of the more advanced functions of Excel such as defined names and \"dynamic charts.\"  These two features alone are quite powerful and would allow you to generate charts that automatically update when you enter new data, allowing you to spend more time analyzing the data rather than creating charts.  You can do some pretty amazing things, though it does take time to develop the expertise required to really make Excel perform at a high level.\nI am attaching an \"Excel Spreadsheet\" I developed in house for the City of Cartersville.  I have tried to incorporate several of the best practices of data visualization (avoiding eye candy, distractions, and \"bad\" charts such as pie charts, 3D charts, and speedometer charts).  You will find two charts types called \"sparklines\" and \"bullet charts\" which are used throughout the dashboard.  There is a built in tutorial which will tell you how to interpret them, along with describing other features of the dashboard such as interactivity.  You will need to enable macros for the dashboard to function properly.\nWhile at this time this model is not generic enough to be easily transferable to other organizations, I have been working on my own time to develop something which could be shared more easily.  I just wanted to share to show you what Excel is capable of.\nSincerely,\nTom\n\n\nHi Sarah,\n\nThis is a good question.

The hard work is in clarifying strategy, goals, and outcomes and then establishing metrics that inform progress towards goals and outcomes. Harder still is the continual effort to link metrics to decision-making. Standard data management and analysis tools like MS Access, SQL, and Excel are more than adequate.  We are now looking to posting performance results on a website for easy user access, but content will still be generated in Excel. Furthermore, questions asked of the data evolve. Stable time-series measures are valuable, but it's also great to be able to analyze the data set to address new questions. Having the data in your own tools like Access & Excel maximize this flexibility. Good luck.\n\n\nI endorse the opinions of Bob and Thomas.

      "text": "\n\nSarah,\nA couple more points - sorry for going on and on, but I really enjoy discussing this stuff!\nFirst - a question for you.  Who do you envision using this software?  Is it intended to generate reports for the public?  Is it geared towards staff (analysts, managers)?  Depending on the answer to that question, you will have different needs.  \nPublic reports are generally going to have to be simpler, using familiar charts (bar, line, pie, etc).  Many jurisdictions have made use of various software packages that can take data (usually from Excel) and create flash based charts that can be hosted on a website.  There is often some interactivity (selecting different measures, mostly).  I would submit that these programs aren't very well suited for an analyst.  While Excel is great for storing data in this case, Excel does not play all that nice with the web, unless you are generating a \"static\" report that can be printed to pdf and uploaded to your website (that's what we currently do).\nOn the other hand, internal reports, which staff can be trained to use/interpret, can be much more complex.  This is where Excel is much more capable and flexible (see my previous comments and the City of Cartersville's example dashboard for further clarification).\nIn the end, the biggest problem I have with Excel is it's inability to work well with the web.  However, to me, the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot.\nAs I mentioned above, I do recommend familiarizing yourself with some of the more advanced functions of Excel.  If you have some time (about an hour, I believe), you can check out this recording of a Webinar I did with the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement where I explained some of the essential techniques for building your own dashboard:\nhttp://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/303256\nUnfortunately, the video quality isn't great, and the sound is worse!  Perhaps it will help.\nOther resources I recommend include:\nexcelhero.com\nchandoo.org\nmrexcel.com/forum (you can ask questions here when you run into a problem, and various Excel loving geeks will gladly help you, surprisingly quickly).\nAlso, if you'd like to chat on the phone, I'm always happy to do so.
