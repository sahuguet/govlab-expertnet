I strongly recommend joining ICLEI-USA  (http://www.ICLEIUSA.org)  if your city is making ongoing investments in energy efficiency.  They provide top notch technical assistance and resources.  An easy place to start on this topic is at EPA and DOE's EnergyStar site.  Here's the link to their finance page:   http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=business.bus_financing .  Also there is, of course, a P3 coalition working on these issues:  http://www.energyservicescoalition.org .    \nWashtenaw County entered into a performance contract with Chevron several years ago and we've been satisfied with the results.  You have to be very attentive in your contract to the bases for evaluation and repayment.  For example, I recommend that you ensure that any presumed labor savings from maintenance are exempted from the determination of total savings because they are too difficult to directly correlate (e.g. are you really going to reduce staff costs because you've saved a thousand hours of maintenance? probably not since your staff is likely overworked anyway!).  Shoot me a note at smithco@ewashtenaw.org if you have trouble tracking down the info you need.\n\n\nEnergy performance contracts are very common and can be structured in a variety of ways.

  "text": "\n\nWe routinely get inquiries from private vendors who offer to install energy-efficient lighting or HVAC system at City facilities, and ask to pay them only through actual annual savings in utility bills.  Such improvements could cost well over $100K and we must follow an open and competitive procurement process.  I am wondering if any city/county has entered into an agreement with any private vendors where the vendor is investing its own $$ for a CIP and gets reimbursed only when savings are realized?  Did you get an exemption from your established procurement process?  A copy of your agreement would be very much helpful.  \nThanks.\n\n",
