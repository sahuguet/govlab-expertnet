  "text": "\n\nAs part of my MPA internship, I am helping my county look at driver education programs aimed at teaching county employees using the county fleet how to improve fuel efficiency while driving. I have done online research and found examples of counties that have certain policies about idling and give tips to drivers. I was wondering if anyone here has a formal driver education policy or has any system in place to get employees to drive more efficiently. \nThanks\nRafael Baptista\n\n",
