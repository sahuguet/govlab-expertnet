Either, alone, is fine.\nI've been reviewing budgets for GFOA for close to 25 years and old habits die hard so I tend to print sections of documents I review when I only get them in electronic form. On the other hand, when I get a hard copy only, I may go online and look at the electronic version at the jurisdiction's website. \nPagination should be the same between the electronic file and the paper version -- i.e., the cover is technically page 1 -- so that the table of contents refers to both the number on the page and the PDF pagination. To do that, paginate in Adobe after the file is assembled and use that to create the table of contents and references in the GFOA submission.\nIf when you print your document you put it in a 3-ring binder, I'd suggest submitting electronically only. Most of the printed documents I have reviewed that arrived in 3-ring binders have started falling out of the binder within the first hour of using it. The record is the one that fell apart as I removed it from the  envelope in which it arrived.\n\n\nWe've done the belt and suspenders approach in recent years -- submitting hard copies and electronic (CD or flash drive).
