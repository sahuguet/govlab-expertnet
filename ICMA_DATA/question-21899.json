In each instance we were seeing evaluations that were well within the \"meets\" standards to \"exceeds\" standards. Knowing that we had under-performers within the ranks, their evalautions were consistently being submitted as \"meets\", thus allowing a pay increase.  \nThe evaluation of the process consisted of interviews with supervisors, employees, and managers. The results concluded that the \"leadership\" of the organization did not want to \"penalize\" their brethern in compensation matters utilizing subjective measures blended with objective criteria.  \nDuring our second try at the PFP we performed indepth training for supervisory and mid-management personnel that consisted of group, one-on-one, and computer refresher training. Upper Management were formally briefed and trained on the program. The direction was simple: Measure the performance of the personnel given the objective criteria provided by the joint labor-management team.  \nThe results were similiar as to the first try. The evaluators did not want to \"penalize\" the under performers.  \nSo, we are back to a STEP compensation program that requires a \"meets\" standards to receive an increase. \nIn studying the dynamics of PFP in the public safety side of government it was determined that for the rank-and-file PFP does not work. The idiosyncracies of firefighter shifts/family persona, emergency services, life-death decision making, and the labor culture create too many subjective and dynamic challenges to creating a PFP at this organizational level of the fire service.  \nWe had been successful in maintaining a PFP for the management level positions for over 20 years, until recenlty when the Governing Board directed changes to the compensation system to conform with the rank-and-file, based on perceptions of management receiving higher increase in compensation in PFP than those in STEP. In reality, the percentages were lower annually, yet, given the higher wages of managers, the annual gross monetary award was higher.\n\n\nGreetings Eddy \n\nWe tried the PFP concept twice over a 20 year period.

It was the Army\u2019s Officer Evaluation Report system.  Besides evaluating the individual\u2019s performance (which many systems can do) this one kept and displayed a profile of how the rater did ratings over time \u2013 and he or she was evaluated on their ability to maintain a bell curve type profile, forcing a few into the bottom blocks and limiting the top block... It did creep up over time, but it was very effective in holding raters accountable for their work and keeping the conversation on true performance.\n\n\nThe core requirement of pay for performance is that someone must provide an objective evaluation of performance for each employee against a known standard and be accountable for the accuracy of their evaluation.\n\nIn over 30 years of management and staff work in federal and local government I have only seen one model that consistently worked over time \u2013 and even it has flaws that must be adjusted.
