Our City utilizes an interagency agreement with WA State\u2019s Dept of General Administration (GA) Surplus Property Program. GA earns a small percentage of any earnings generated through their processing and selling of our surplus. This fee is well worth their service to us of storing, selling, disposing, properly transferring ownership, etc. of surplus vehicles, equipment, supplies, and furniture. The City\u2019s main role is to administratively or legislatively declare material as surplus, submit the items to GA through their online tool, and then make arrangements to drop off the material at GA. Once we drop it off, they take care of it from there and we don\u2019t worry about it further. Most of our vehicles have sold with minimal City staff time/effort.  We have also been able to sell other equipment and items through GA.  Citizens interested in purchasing the surplus material can be directed to GA.  Perhaps your state has this GA service option.\n\n\nSection 2.70.100 of our municipal code, found at http://www.codepublishing.com/wa/bonneylake/,  \n addresses the disposition of surplus material.

  "text": "\n\nAll-\nDoes anyone have a policy written that covers how excess equipment, such as old computers and desks is disposed of by their local government?  What about for scrap, say old culverts at the Public Works department?   I am looking for something that talks about the process of getting rid of items and perhaps touches also upon how if any way a citizen could purchase, say an old culvert, in a pseudo recycling way.\nThanks.\nRichard Downey\n\n",
