  "text": "\n\nWe have a merit based pay raise system which on its surface seems fair, and a good way to promote productivity and innovation, but because we are a public sector our amount for raises is set by our Commissioners in the prior budget year.\nLast year for instance, it was an average of a 2% increase for all employees.   The money is distributed out based on a performance evaluation. The trouble is that for one person to score higher than 2% for good work, means that someone else must get lower than 2%. For one person to do well, another must do poorly in order to create an average of 2%.  \nGood workers should be compensated, but should adequate workers be penalized? Are there better systems out there?\n\n",
