  "text": "\n\nThe City of Walnut Creek, California is interested in learning how other agencies manage murals within their city.  \nSpecifically, does your agency encourage and/or support murals that are visible to the general public? If the answer is yes, how does your agency govern the placement of artistic murals (whether they are on public or private buildings)? Is the process overseen by your design review Commission (or an equivalent body) or is it governed by an Arts Commission? \nAny specific ordinances you have (or links to yours) are also appreciated.  Thanks so much.\n\n",
