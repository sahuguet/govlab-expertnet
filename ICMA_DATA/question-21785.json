  "text": "\n\nThe City of Walnut Creek, California is interested in learning about other cities' walking historical/art tours. Currently, many of our buildings and sites have bronze plaques installed by the owners with no consistency as to message or what qualifies as \"historical\", or as \"public art\". \nWe would like to find what other cities are doing with regard to historic and/or public art tours (particularly in downtowns), as far as markings, signage, self guided tours and other printed or electronic material. Ideas, links to your information, or contact info will be especially helpful.\nThank you!\n\n",
