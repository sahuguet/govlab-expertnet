From browsing the Knowledge Network is appears that this is a relatively popular appraisal and evaluation tool used by some local governments.  \"Asking the Right Questions\" is a document that covers creating a 360 feedback tool (icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/305637). \"Creating a Leadership Development Program: Nine Essential Tasks\" used 360 feedback systems as part of their professional development program (icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/5517). Finally the Village of Schaumburg uses a version of 360 feedback to help their employees with their personal and professional development in \"Village of Schaumburg's Talent Management Program\" (icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/100296). I hope you find these documents helpful as you make your decision about using 360 feedback systems for performance appraisals. Also if any other local government officials have any examples of this please include them in your answers and submit them to the Knowledge Network. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Rebecca, \n\nThank you for your question on 360 feedback systems.
