I would be very appreciative of your feedback and responses. \nQuestions: If you are a department head or a City Manager and practicing Succession Planning? If so, do you have a formalized or informal plan? If it is an informal plan, what are the hindrances you face to formalize the plan?\nThank you!\n\n",
