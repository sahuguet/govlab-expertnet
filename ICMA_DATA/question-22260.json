Background: he and I are close, personal friends (over 20 years); I have not campaigned for him - even though I live in his district (not even a yard sign); I am a CA in a city within the same county.  I am a friend and constituent, but do not want to compromise my ICMA ethical pledge.  Comments or suggestions?  Thanks.\n\n",
