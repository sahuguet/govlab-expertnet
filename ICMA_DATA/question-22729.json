      "text": "\n\nHi Daniel,\nThank you for the great question about Police Chief performance reviews. Unfortunately we currently have no examples of police chief performance review questions on our website, but we do have some great articles about performance evaluations and performance evaluations of those who are in executive positions, such as a police chief.\n\u00b7         The city of Bangor has posted in the documents their process for executive employee evaluation. This could help to provide you with general strategies when it comes to thinking about evaluating high level employees such as the police chief. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/3548/Executive_Employee_Evaluation_Process\n\u00b7         This is a previously answered question about innovative performance evaluations with links to many great articles about performance evaluations that different cities around the US are using. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/kn/Question/21468\n\u00b7         View and Review: Questions for Performance Reviews is a great article that provides many different questions and question topics that should be included in performance reviews of all levels of government. These questions and meant to help ensure sustained local government productivity. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/blogs/blogpost/1223/View_and_Review_Questions_for_Performance_Reviews\n\u00b7         The Klamath Falls Police Department has put their employee performance review on ICMA\u2019s website and while it does not pertain specifically to police chiefs it may be helpful to see another local government\u2019s performance evaluation take into account in creating the performance evaluation for your police chief. \nhttp://ci.klamath-falls.or.us/sites/ci.klamath-falls.or.us/files/police.doc\nI hope these documents are helpful as you move forward with creating your police chief\u2019s performance evaluation. If anyone has any sample performance evaluations please add them to the documents on the knowledge network so this helpful information can be available to all.\nBest,\nRobin Saywitz\nICMA Knowledge Network Intern\nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Daniel,\nThank you for the great question about Police Chief performance reviews.
