  "text": "\n\nOur City is partnering with the County to undertake a fall election to maintain existing sales tax monies we receive on purchases of out of state vehicles.  A recent Missouri Supreme Court ruling struck down the ability to collect sales tax on these out of state sales.  Before this ruling city and county were receiving said monies ; no more.  \nAs our campaign is taking shape, I feel we should include reference to the pending federal Marketplace Fairness Act which levies an internet sales tax.  The point, absent the voters approving the use tax on out of state vehicle purchases, we would also miss out on receiving internet sales taes as well.  \nThoughts ?\n\n",
