If the employee is required to respond to the call or message, the employee should leave the meeting room to answer the call to minimize any disruption to the rest of the participants and trainer/presenter.  The City expects employees to exhibit this courtesy to the trainer/presenter and to the other employees and attendees who would otherwise become distracted.  Employees attempting to read or answer messages during meetings or training events may be reported to their immediate supervisor and department director for appropriate discussion and/or disciplinary action.\n\n\nOur City recently adopted the following:\n\nMeetings/Training:  Except in urgent or emergency situations, employees attending any meeting or training event, on or off-site, in which they are representing the City, will turn off or at a minimum, silence their cell phones/pagers.
