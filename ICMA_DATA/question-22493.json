  "text": "\n\nWe recently had our department policy of a tobacco free building and patrol cars challenged as it pertains to smokeless (chewing) tobacco.  Per current department policy;\n\"Employees of the department will not use tobacco while engaged in traffic control, on an investigation, in City vehicles/buildings or while otherwise in contact with the public.\"\nThose who smoke have an area behind our police department to smoke which follows state law, A.R.S. 36-601.01.  Is there a reasonable accommodation for those who chew tobacco that will also take into the concideration the public and the other employees who would be exposed to this?\n\n",
