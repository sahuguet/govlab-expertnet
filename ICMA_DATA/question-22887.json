  "text": "\n\nI am wondering if a city out there has experience in purchasing blighted/foreclosed homes, paying for demolition of the site and contracting a builder to build a new home.  \nThe City of West St. Paul (MN, first ring suburb) purchased and demolished around 15 homes in 2009 and 2010.  We were successful in selling the majority of the lots to builders who have built new homes and sold them privately, however we have a handful of lots left that have not sold.  \nAs a result, we are considering the option of fronting the construction cost by contracting the construction with a local builder with the idea that it would be more of an attractive deal for the builder (less risky).\nIf anyone has experience with something similar, good or bad, we would love to hear from you.\nThanks,\nBen Boike\nAssistant Comm. Dev. Dir.\nWest St. Paul, MN\n651-552-4134\n\n",
