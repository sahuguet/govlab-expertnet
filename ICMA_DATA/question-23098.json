  "text": "\n\nDo you install GPS tracking systems on vehicles in the City fleet? If so, do you install them in all vehicles in the fleet or just certain vehicles? How do you determine which vehicles to track? \nAre employees made aware that vehicles are being tracked? How did you address the organizational culture with respect to implementing a tracking system?\nHow is the information reviewed and used? Did your insurance premiums go down once vehicles were able to be tracked?\nAny other information on this subject that relates to how your City has implemented a vehicle tracking program would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks.\n\n",
