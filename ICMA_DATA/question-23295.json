Definitely attend any state or ICMA conferences you can- the more people you reach out to the better.  Make sure to ask your City Manager in your hometown, in Cleveland, and other municipalities you know well for any leads on jobs or communities that may be looking at hiring.  As a first job out of school, don't be afraid of a department-specific job.  Sometimes Analysts and Assistant To jobs are harder to come by.  Having experience performing Clerk, finance, public safety, public works duties just makes you more valuable and easy to relate to when in the manager's office.  If your goal is to be a manager, just make sure you get as much experience as you can while in the early stages of your career.  No job in local government will hurt you in becoming a Manager.  Be patient, apply for anything and everything, and a job will come!  Best wishes for your final year!\n\n\nDefinitely check out the ICMA Local Government Management Fellows program- it's a great step from student to professional.

      "text": "\n\nBrian, \nI would have to echo what Jennifer and Rob have stated. As a current ICMA fellow, I can say it certainly is a bridge from student to professional. \nOne place to look is : www. governmentjobs.com (Houses all the job postings by governments that use NEOGOV. This covers state and local level jobs). \nAnother place to consider is the respective state's league of cities website. There's usually a classified/job posting page available.  You might be able to find a city that isn't posting to ICMA that may be on the league of city's classified page.  Or the states' respective CMA website (e.g. OCMA- Ohio City/County Manager Association). \nOhio has a township association which has a classified page as well; although, I am unsure of what other states have. \nThe last thing I will note is that sometimes, communities will simply just post on their website and/or local newspaper. So simply going to each individual community human resource/employment web-page is an option.  The below website is helpful. It doesn't list all the communities in a state, but it does list some. The places that are listed; however, they are hyper-linked straight to the human resource/employment page to save click-through time searching for that page. \nhttp://www.ecoemploy.com/noindex/statemp.html \nGood Luck!\n\n\nBrian, \nI would have to echo what Jennifer and Rob have stated.

  "text": "\n\nHello everyone.\nI have a similar question/scenario as Luke described. I will be graduating in May 2015 with my MPPA from the University of Tennessee. \nI have extensive experience in local government. I have worked in the City Manager's Office in Cleveland, Tennessee  5 consecutive summers and currently staying another 4 months until the conclusion of my fall 2014 semester. I have enjoyed working in local government along with the challenges and opportunities facing municipalities of all sizes. I  am very fortunate this opportunity was available. \nThe two sources mentioned in Luke's answer provide great insight into general knowledge and preparation of a resume/cover letter and interview process, but do not really offer insight into breaking in full-time employment for graduating students other than utilizing head hunters.\nAny thoughts, suggestions, or ideas?\nThank you!\nBrian Moran\n\n",
