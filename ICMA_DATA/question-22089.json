From my perspective, trying to define growth can be elusive because it can have so many components which means I have found that the best starting point is to reach agreement on the baseline of such factors as commercial/industrial vacancy rates, commercial/industrial property assessed value, total jobs filled, unemployment rate, etc.  Indeed, the choice of baseline factors can be as important as establishing the baseline.  The four factors I cited are generally sufficient to form a baseline.  Once there is a baseline with accepted values from verifiable sources then the question has to be answered as to what is considered growth which, again, can be subjective based on what the goals or policy guides are for the community.\n\n\nThe International Economic Development Council which is the ICMA equivalent for economic development professionals has an advisory services unit that should be able to point you in the right direction for the information you need.
