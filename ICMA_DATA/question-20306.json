  "text": "\n\nI am sure that it will vary by city but I would like to know, as best practices go, what is the proper command structure (i.e. deputy chiefs, captians to lieutenants to sergeants, etc.) for a department in an urban city of 300K in northeast.\nSimilar question for a fire department in same size city as regards deputy chiefs, battalion cheifs, fire captians, fire fighters. \nAlso, can you direct me to most recent stats on police officers and fire fighters per capita in cities in the northeast.\nAny guidelines or general rules you can provide for a properly aligned command structure in these departments would be much appreciated.\nMelvin L. Waldrop\n\n",
