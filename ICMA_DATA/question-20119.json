  "text": "\n\nWe have a local record retention policy and an excellent historical filing system for documents.  Unfotunately, we decided to send our policy to the MD State Archives.  Apparently, to keep a local \"archive\" you need to meet state law... which contains the following requirement:\n\"The minimum qualifications for the archivist or archivists responsible for managing the daily operations of a local archives shall include graduation from an accredited: \nA. Four-year college or university, preferably with a degree in history, archival science, library science, or related field and 3 years of full-time, or its equivalent, professional archival experience; or \nB. College or university with a Master's degree in history, archival science, library science, or related field and 2 years of full-time, or its equivalent, profesional archival experience.\"\nI know by posting I'm risking arrest and detainment by the \"document police,\" but really... does anyone have an \"archivist\" on staff?  Are you sending critical documents like your deeds, annexations, legal files, etc., to Annapolis?  As best I can tell, the intent of the State is to duplicate the closing scene in the first Indiana Jones movies.\nOh, and off topic... I liked the old forum format better.\n\n",
