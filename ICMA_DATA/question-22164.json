  "text": "\n\nGood afternoon,\nRecently our City Council identified the public library and aquatic center as service areas where they would like to review service delivery alternatives.  Over the next couple of months we will be going through a process with them to identify which services in each of these areas we will continue to provide.  The second step will be to engage an outside consultant to review the services and provide recommendations on whether it is more feasible to maintain the services in-house, develop a public-private partnership or partner with a neighboring community for service.\nI would be interested to hear of any other communities that have gone through a similar service review for either their public library or aquatic center(s).  In addition, if you worked with a consultant to review those service areas I would be interested to know who you worked with?\nThanks,\nMatt McQuillen\nCity of Clive, IA\n\n",
