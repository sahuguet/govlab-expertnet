  "text": "\n\nOur City is interested in launching a mobile app.  First and foremost, we want citizens to be able to report problems/concerns, along the lines of a 311 reporting system.  We'd also like to offer other useful features so it's not just a 311 app, but has a broader appeal and is another tool to reach out to our citizens.  We're not a tourism destination so these features should be useful and interesting to the average resident.  I'm interested in information on the following:\n1)  Do you have a specific 311-type app that you can recommend?  I'm familiar with See Click Fix so I'm looking for other options - not opposed to See Click Fix, just want to understand all the options out there.\n2)  Does your City have an app?  If so, what features do you think are beneficial and have been well used by your residents?\n3)  Can you recommend any app development companies?\nThanks in advance for any information that can be shared.\nJessica Roth\nCity of Suwanee, GA\n\n",
