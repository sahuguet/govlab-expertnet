      "text": "\n\nWhether trying to consolidate police, fire, EMS, or dispatch, the first thing that needs to be established is the workload that will be handled by a consolidated or new department. If the workload of the separate units is too great, any savings or improvements may be limited. However, dispatch is often viewed as the low-hanging fruit when looking to implement system improvements as well as save costs. The proper design is critical to providing the necessary information from which fire, police, EMS, and any other services are evaluated. \nWe are seeing a number of trends in dispatch: co-location, virtual consolidation, consolidation and managed services. All of the trends have positive and negative aspects; the initial evaluation of the desired system will often indicate which may be more beneficial. \nWorking with many communities, we often find that good data is often lacking to perform comprehensive evaluations. It is for that reason that we often begin with raw data generated from Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) records which can be evaluated without emotion that often accompanies consolidation. If you are desiring that dispatch will meet national benchmarks or perform as effectively as the service is currently delivered, it will be critical to determine what that level is before designing a replacement system. The Center has worked with several communities through strategic relationships which have produced a variety of outcomes. Key to any decision will be the performance levels now and what is desired after consolidation.\n\n\nWhether trying to consolidate police, fire, EMS, or dispatch, the first thing that needs to be established is the workload that will be handled by a consolidated or new department.

  "text": "\n\nThe city is currently utilizing two separate outside agencies to provide emergency dispatch services for the city's public safety departments. We are beginning the process of tyring to determine what the costs of bringing those services in house would be and if combining the dispatch for the two departments is a workable solution. Has anyone been through such a conversion recently and/or have any insight on how to gauge the costs (and benefits) of such a venture?\n\n",
