The Criteria provide a systems perspective for understanding performance management in just 19 pages (pp 7-26). They reflect validated, leading-edge management practices against which an organization can measure itself. With their acceptance nationally and internationally as the model for performance excellence, the Criteria also represent a common language for sharing best practices among organizations, and, best of all, this document is absolutely free at http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/2011_2012_Business_Nonprofit_Criteria.pdf  I have attached a pdf copy.\n\n\nBrandy, I would strongly recommend the inclusion of the 2011-2012 Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence (referred to as the Business/Nonprofit Criteria) as used by businesses and nonprofit/government organizations.

The podcasts are produced by a small team of management consultants, and although not specific to the world of local government, I've found the insights and recommendations to be extremely useful and have put many into practice with positive results.
