Our process is meant to be more of an internal guidance tool rather than a change in how we present the budget to the Board and the public.\nWe've structured our methodology to support three forms in our budget packet, which we call the Inventory, Scorecard and Performance Measures forms. We will have departments break their activities into four to eight programs (we're erring on the side of simplicity for the first year) and then report on the financials for each of the programs (FY11 and FY12).\nThe Scorecard form allows the department, with its budget analyst, to score each program based on 10 criteria, including how well each contributes to the strategic plan goals.\nNext, we ask the departments to come up with three measures for each program (output, outcome and efficiency). Taken together with the score from the Scorecard form, these measures will help us identify what programs need help.\nThe program budgeting flows through to our other budget forms as well. Each request for new/reclassified positions, capital and additional funding are made by identifying what program the new spending is associated with.\nI've attached our performance budgeting forms for you to see. As I mentioned above, we're not anticipating any changes to the budget we present to the public, but we're looking forward to being able to understand how each program works on a level playing field; for example, we think the way we've structured the methodology will allow parks programs to be fairly compared to, say, public safety.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nMegan Bourke\nbourkem@chesterfield.gov\n\n\nWe just launched a program/performance based budgeting methodology in Chesterfield County, VA.

      "text": "\n\nI  have worked with  various types of program budgets since the early 1980's and have found that the best approach is to start to understand what you do and how much it costs to do that. I worked with ICMA on their financial monitoring indicators program, see a good version on the DCED website at www.newPA.com. Using this as a guideline, you can begin to programs, units of measurement and costs for your municipality. I used this background info to project a programs cost for the next five years and included 5 years of historical cost data and 5 years of projected cost data in the budget. I also never had a prescribed budget process, with the five year forward budget, every month, next years budgetary data was updated, so you kept the elected officials, public and staff informed as to what next years budget was going to be like. When 2008 hit, the community I was working in developed a five step program that could be implemented overtime based on how the economic climate was changing. Using this approach, you could determine what programs could be reduced in scope, eliminated or defered and what impact that would have on future years budgets. You could also use the data to show how to catch up on those programs you deferred and what impact that would have on future budgets.\nIt took the better part of three years to put this type of program budget together but once it was done, it provided excellent info based on what the community was doing. I later expanded the program budget to be guided by the goals and objectives of the community as represented by the elected officials. the budget had specific written goals, either in the short term or long term, what resources were to be used to obtain those goals and what long term costs/benefits could be accured as a result of the achieving the goals. I do not put a lot of faith in specific types of program budgets but have relied on a variety of types and what works best for the communities that I have worked in. This approach has been used extensively in three different communities over 20+ years.\n\n\nI  have worked with  various types of program budgets since the early 1980's and have found that the best approach is to start to understand what you do and how much it costs to do that.
