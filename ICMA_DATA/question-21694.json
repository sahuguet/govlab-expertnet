The Albemarle County Police Department in Virginia does not have a specific policy for issuing retirement credentials. However, the department does issue a retirement badge and ID.  This is not a badge of authority, but a service regonition.  The retired officers do not attend their 40 hours of training every two year to maintain their law enforcement certification. \nThe department does have a policy to issue a concealed weapon permit.  Virginia law allows the department to issue the permit instead of the circuit court, which would issue a permit for a citizen.  The retired members must qualify according to department standards every year.  The permit allows the reitred office to fall under the Federal Law Enforcement ACT of 2004 and possess a concealed firearm throughout the United States.\n\n\nI realize this is past the needed response date, but I hope this helps.

What administrative oversight is required to ensure firearm training is current - specifically in States with carrying/concealment laws?  What enforcement powers are extended to the retired officers?  What employment record/history is required to qualify for recognition?  Any thoughts in this area, specifically samples of existing policy, would be appreciated.\n\n",
