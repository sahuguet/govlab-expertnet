  "text": "\n\nUber/Lyft and other ride-sourcing companies are increasing transit options in urban cores.  However, such services often do not fall under traditional/current regulations.   Does anyone have suggestions, best-practices, recent experience, or academic material promoting/discouraging ride-sourcing (often called ridesharing) options? Are regulations needed?   If you would like to provide feedback, please feel free to contact me at TBeeninga@fortlauderdale.gov or call (954) 828-3799. \nThanks!\n\n",
