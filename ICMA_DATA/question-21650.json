      "text": "\n\nHello,\nAt the Virginia Beach Central Library, we purchased an iPad for staff use using the vending machine funds.  This iPad however is not supported through our City ComIT and thus is not on our staff network; however, we did develop some guidelines of usage.  We have a team of iPad coordinators who maintain the updates to this piece of equipment.  We do not use a passcode lock, but keep the iPad in a secure location when not in use. We use the machine mostly for Internet browsing and to educate our customers on downloadable book processes, so we don't  have much need for storage or the Cloud player.\nAlthough these iPad policies aren't City-wide, we hope this document helps address some of your questions.\n\n\nHello,\nAt the Virginia Beach Central Library, we purchased an iPad for staff use using the vending machine funds.

(If you're only deploying a small number of iPads, you might leave all the configuration up to the users).\nKnowing the large number of stories of lost laptops with sensitive information on them, I'd highly recommend any iPad, personal or enterprise, enable the passcode lock AND activate the free Find My iPhone/iPad App. That will allow you to locate or remotely wipe your iPad in case it is lost or stolen.\n\n\nApple has a pretty useful enterprise deployment resource area that you could use to help inform your decisions (though not specific to any industry, it's likely geared toward the private sector):\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/ipad/enterprise/\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipad/business/resources/\n\nFor the connection, unless someone is frequently traveling and requires the 3G connection, you might get wifi only iPads and eliminate the concern over paying for a connection.

      "text": "\n\nSuwanee, GA - we purchased iPads for our City Council and management staff almost a year ago.  The City purchased WiFi models with the intent that they would be owned by the City.  This would mean that they would be treated the same as other City-owned devices - could not set up personal e-mail accounts, use personal apps, etc.  As we began using them, it quickly became apparent that this would not be the ideal set-up as that would mean you'd essentially have to carry around two tablets.  So, we decided that if you wanted to add your personal accounts, apps, etc. to the iPad, you could purchase it from the City and it would be your device that you would use for both City and personal business.  The users were offered the ability to do this through a payroll deduction (maximum of one year payback period).  Almost everyone decided to go this route.  Each user uses their personal iTunes account.  The City reimburses the users for any apps that are required for City business, such as iAnnotate for viewing Council packets, FileBrowser for accessing the City's network, etc.  We decided early on to do the WiFi models so we did not discuss who would have paid for a 3G connection.  We have a similar model in place for cell phones - the  City gives employees stipends and then we use our personal cell phones for both City and personal business.\n\n\nSuwanee, GA - we purchased iPads for our City Council and management staff almost a year ago.

While it was a good idea in theory, it has created some ongoing problems.  They each reconfigured their iPads to add their personal iTunes account after we did this.  The apps I downloaded are still tied to the account I created.  Whenever there is an app update, you have to put in the password for my account.  While I've given them the password, they always seem to come to me for this update.  I believe you can get around this by syncing the iPad to your computer, but some of our Councilmembers don't do this.  In the long run, it would have been better if we had them download all apps from their personal accounts.\n\n\nOne more lesson that we learned...to make the set-up easier for our Councilmembers, our City Manager asked me to create a iTunes account for City use and then to download the apps we knew they would need, such as iAnnotate, FileBrowser, etc.  This would eliminate them having to download (and pay for these apps) and then configure them.
