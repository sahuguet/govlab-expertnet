I can recommend ICMA's orientation page ( http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics/kn/Topic/186/Orientation#Tab=Overview ) which may have some helpful documentation. You can also try contacting the topic leaders on the right hand side to see if they can help you further. Their email addresses are listed in their profiles. \nBeyond that, I can only provide some links to orientation manuals for other cities and states that I found through a Google search. There may be specific passages in each one that may help you in your search.\nCity of St. Cloud, Minnesota: http://bit.ly/g2h3J3\nState of Vermont: http://bit.ly/gCof1Q\nMunicipalities in Missouri (this one has sections that deal with parliamentary procedures, agenda items and other process-oriented questions): http://bit.ly/f9omDQ\nHope this helps. Good luck!\n\n\nHi Jessica, \n\nI think it's going to be difficult to find examples that dovetail completely with your own city's policies and procedures.

  "text": "\n\nOur City is interested in creating an orientation packet for newly elected officials.  We are aware that most, if not all, of the state municipal associations produce such a document.  However, we want to put one together that is specific to our City - what types of purchases do we reimburse, how do elected officials get items on the agenda, what level of staffing can they expect, etc.?  If anyone has any examples that they could share so we can get ideas for the various issues that should be included, I'd appreciate it!\nJessica Roth\nAsst. to City Manager\nCity of Suwanee, GA\njroth@suwanee.com\n\n",
