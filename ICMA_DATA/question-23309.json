We took the carrot approach, by emphasizing the convenience of electronic bill pay and lock box.  Because many residents don't have access to the internet and don't do electronic banking (may not even have a checking account), those efforts could only go so far.  Many lower income residents feel better about presenting a payment directly to a customer service representative and getting that receipt.  It makes them feel safe.  To charge them a fee to interface with a human could be politically challenging.   Best of luck, whichever way you go.\n\n\nIn short, no.

This is an opportunity to hear what the \"average\" citizen has to say about many different subjects, including how we are doing in providing municipal services to them. While we do receive a significant amount of our utility payments via electronic banking or through the mail, we do have quite a bit of walk up payment traffic and I don't foresee that going away anytime soon.\n\n\nI may be oversimplifying the issue, but I have always looked at our cashiering function as an opportunity to interface with constituents that might never darken the doorways of city hall otherwise.

The observation that such a fee would likely disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged populations makes the option all the more unsavory.\nUnlike online transactions, which have real added costs to municipalities that can be offset through a \"convenience charge\", in-person window transactions presumably have their costs already accounted for in the municipal budget. Adding a window service convenience fee targeting primarily economically disadvantaged populations is a patently bad idea. If costs are not being covered, I would look to other tools for offsetting cashiering costs, such as broader increase that is spread across all transactions cashier staff handle - a change to base fees, not a special penalty for interacting with staff.\nIf the objective is simply to influence behavior (not recover costs), then I would think that education and reward is the way to go.

If there's not already an Internet kiosk in City/Village Hall, consider making one available to walk-ins for bill payment. Perhaps there could even be an incentive, like a small discount or perhaps a raffle to get people to start doing it, etc. Here in Oak Park (IL), for example, we do not charge convenience fees for online transactions. In addition, to encourage folks to get vehicle stickers online we actually provide a $5 discount. We encourage folks to use the payment methods that are most advantageous to our operations, but kindly accept payment through whichever mode a particular remitter finds most convenient.\nI strongly advise against an in-person service convenience fee.\n\n\nIt seems unreasonable to implement a fee for in-person utility payment service.

  "text": "\n\nOur management staff and finance department are looking at implementing user fees for those patrons who choose to pay for their utility bills and other cash based transactions directly at the finance office in village hall. The community population is very polarized socio-economically, and as such the mid to upper middle class portion of the population pay via online banking or are more than willing to accept the convenience fee for using a credit card. This is in contrast to the low income portion which almost exclusively pay at the finance window. The philosophy behind the user fees would be to reduce the amount of hours the finance department spends dealing with window customers and counting/accounting for checks/cash. We would like to see the portion of the community utilizing this window service pay their utility bills by means of online banking applications, via the village website, or a lock box. Has anyone had any luck implementing user fees for their window services or knowledge of communities who have?\n\n",
