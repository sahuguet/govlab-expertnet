Of that total, 223 cities have a sitting city manager/administrator (classified collectively as chief administrative officer) whose name ICMA knows, whether or not an ICMA member.  The remaining 47 cities might provide for a position of professional local government management and might even have someone fulfilling that role but ICMA does not have that information.  There are more than 70,000 local governments that are not recorded in ICMA's database.\nHope this helps.  Please feel free to contact me directly if you have further questions related to form of government.\n\n\nHi Jeff:\n\nAccording to ICMA's information, there are 270 cities in Minnesota.
