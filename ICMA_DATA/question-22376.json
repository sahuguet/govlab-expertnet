      "text": "\n\nGreg,\nHave you tried asking you regional planning commission (if you have those in your state)?   I have used these organizations and have found them most helpful.  I have done EOPs in two different states, and while they are similar, it has been my experience that each state\u2019s emergency management agency (actually another source you might want to try) has some differences in their templates and sometimes areas they emphasize, and the local planning agencies are usually up to date on these issues.  This of course makes sense, since the major threats in states tend to vary.  Also, the FEMA website is a good resource for a national/basic view, and their input as you probably know plays a large part in the respective state/local plans.\n\n\nGreg,\nHave you tried asking you regional planning commission (if you have those in your state)?

  "text": "\n\nI wanted to ask whether anyone knew of a basic template for an emergency operations plan for a small city.   I am hoping to find a guidance document geared towards small cities or villages that would have an appropriate template as an appendix.\nFailing that, perhaps a plan from a small city that could be used as a model would be helpful\nThank you\nGreg Welter\ngreg.welter@obg.com\n\n",
