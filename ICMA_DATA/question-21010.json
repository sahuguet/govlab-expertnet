While we are not using a consulting firm, we are seeking citizen input on usability and ultimately format.  \nWe had a very short survey on our website and also invited members of the community to come in and try to complete some simple tasks on the website.  They then gave us feedback on how usable and intuitive it was.  We also had a very informal conversation about what they would like to see on the site.  The survey is on our website still at www.harrisonburgva.gov if you are interested in seeing it.\nWe are now at the point where we have drawn up a \"road map\" of how we would like the site to function and our webmaster is moving forward with design and restructuring.  Once she is done with that, we will have a beta testing group that functions similarly to the testing group we brought in to see if we hit our marks.  We anticipate doing a number of these at different stages.\nStaff went through a similar analysis and feedback process before we moved into citizen groups, which was also very helpful.\nLet me know if you have questions or would like more information.\n\n\nHi Chantal.
