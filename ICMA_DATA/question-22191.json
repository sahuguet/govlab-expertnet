      "text": "\n\nThomas makes a great suggestion. Having a benchmark to compare against gives you real information. If you had a question such as \"Overall I think Anytown is a good place to live\" and got a 65% Agree & Strongly Agree rating, you might think that sounds really good. But you might feel differently if you found out that other cities of a similar size/demographic average a 80% rating.\nEven if you don't go with a comparative instrument, you need to be prepared to do repeated on-going measurement on the same questions to tell you how things are progressing over time.\n\n\nThomas makes a great suggestion.
