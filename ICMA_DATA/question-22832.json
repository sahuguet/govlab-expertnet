We ask departments to show some customer service measures, efficiency and outcome measures.  We discourage showing input and output measures.  We show this data both in our Performance Management system and in our Annual Performance Report which can be viewed at http://www.bellevuewa.gov/pdf/Finance/2012_Annual_Perf_Rpt_2.pdf\n\n\nThe City of Bellevue does not have a formal limit by department.

There are two to three per page for each division, for example Street Maintenance or Persons Crimes, and a three to five are listed on the page for each department. The budget is online at http://www.wichita.gov/Government/Departments/Finance/Pages/Budget.aspx. \nIf you have a problem with paring the measures, create a format for the pages and stick with it. Then there won't be room for the measures to go on and on.\nGood luck with your budget document!\nElizabeth\n\n\nThat is a great question!\n\nThe City of Wichita collects far more performance measures than we report in the budget book.

  "text": "\n\nWhat is the average number of performance measures per department for the budget document?  If utilizing departments and their subdivisions listings, then the list tends to get fairly large.  Operational PMs are as many as the manager needs to get a good picture of his/her's departments performance.  How do you pare down the PMs for the budget?  Thanks, Arnoldo Perez\n\n",
