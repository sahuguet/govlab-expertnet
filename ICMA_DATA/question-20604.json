We've been through 3 hurricanes and a 21-fatality tornado with this system in place and it works well.  I'll try to get some information together and either get it to you or post here in the near future.  I will also get you POC info for our emergency management and GIS directors so that you can speak with them directly.  Happy GIS Day!\nGregg Welstead\n\n\nTodd,\nOur GIS folks actively participate in the EOC operation and, during activation, at least 2 analysts are present (and very busy) at all times.

We keep data and licenses available so that we can set up on any computer quickly. The GIS section manages the Town's Enterprise GIS. Data is stored in a SQL database and is accessible via the intranet. We have some departmental desktop licenses which allow departments to create their own data and maps, if needed. The GIS Section creates and maintains database data, are responsible for purchasing licensing and overseas licensing maintenance. Additional licenses are purchased as the need arises. Additional funding is requested at such time. For EOC situations we keep thumb drives containing copies of our data in shapefile and file database format. These are updated regularly and distributed to each GIS employee. That way any employee who is able to respond will have data available if the GIS server and database are not accessible. We currently do not utilize web applications but would like to move towards that in the future. The local council of government houses copies of most local municipalities\u2019 data and this works as an additional back up for us. This data is available on the web as interactive maps or downloadable shapefiles. Our MIS Section backs up the GIS data on a daily/weekly basis, depending on the data. \nOn the thumb drives and server we also have existing GIS projects and maps. The projects contain what we think may be required in an EOC, as well as existing data. Empty symbolized layers exist (for example helipads) so they can be populated quickly, as needed. We have set naming conventions for exporting maps which include time and date markers so that we will have a record of what was done and when. The existing maps include anything we think we may need to print out quickly (streets, churches, hospitals etc.). All GIS staff members have completed at least the minimum required FEMA training to enter the EOC. Digital certificates of NIMS training are also stored on thumb drives. That seems intuitive, but I was surprised to find out how few people have taken this step. I also volunteer with a regional response team (EGRET) and participate in training and exercises with them.  \nNicole\n\n\nThe Town of Flower Mound does not have GIS equipment dedicated to our EOC, but does have steps in place to move equipment from offices if the call arises.

Do you have dedicated equipment and data? Do you access an enterprise GIS?  Who is responsible for buying and maintaining i.e. centralized or department/agency-based?  Where is equipment/data stored? How is software licensing handled?  What kinds of funding models are used?  How is governance handled?  \nThanks in advance for any information you can provide related to the above questions or other considerations you deem important!  \nTodd\n\n",
