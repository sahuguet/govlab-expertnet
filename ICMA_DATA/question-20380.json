  "text": "\n\nThe City of Flagstaff, AZ has developed a draft Report on Roof Collapses and Snow Load Requirements Study (attached) and is hoping to get feedback from other communities regarding three critical issues that we struggled with in our study:\n\nWhat are the snow load requirements (pounds per square foot)?\nHow are snow removal orders disseminated (Press Release, Social Media, E-mails etc)?\nHow are the snow fall accumulated weights calculated (internal gauging system, utilizing national weather service, etc)?\n\nI would also like any feedback you can provide regarding our draft study if you have the time.\nThank you!\nMike Iacona\nFire Chief\nCity of Flagstaff, AZ\n928-779-7688\nmiacona@ci.flagstaff.az.us\n\n",
