  "text": "\n\nICMA's Center for Performance Measurement\u2122 (CPM) is dedicated to helping local governments improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of public services through the collection, reporting, analysis, and application of performance information. \nBased on limited feedback we have received through embedded survey comments and emails, CPM is considering developing a survey around water and wastewater services. We've developed a brief survey to help us understand what data on water and wastewater services are currently collected. Please use (or share) the link below to report what water and wastewater services are provided by your local government.  The results will be analyzed to determine if CPM should pursue the development of a water and wastewater survey, which would be available in for CPM participants in September 2013. Both current CPM participants and non-participants are encouraged to fill out the survey.\nSurvey link: https://icma.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4N0l4O3O1ueYolv\nThank you in advance for your participation in this survey, which should take about 15 minutes to complete. The survey will be open until Friday, April 19th. Additional information on CPM can be found on our website or by e-mailing cpmmail@icma.org.\n\n",
