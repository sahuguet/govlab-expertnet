  "text": "\n\nThe City of Ames has been asked to participate in an Accountable Care Organization with Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield.  The first year we would be \"testing\" the program as a self-insured municipality as a demonstration.  \nI am wondering if anyone out there has been participating this model of health insurance that is quality performance based?  If you have learned positives or negatives from participating??  We would like experiences for both for the municipal organization perspective and from an employee perspective.  We have five labor unions, so we approach changes with caution - even tests.  We have been told that employees should not notice much on their end, but we want to know that is the case from others that have participated this type of model.  \nThank you ICMA friends for any information you can share with me!\n\n",
