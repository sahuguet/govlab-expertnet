      "text": "\n\nHi,\nWorking as structural firefighting expert for years, intructing flashover instructor all around the world, I'm sometimes asked for such a question (Im French, so poor english level! :)  ). The problem is not the vehicles but what you can do with it, and, on all cases, what are you FF able to do. When we see the wayUS FF work, we see that they use an important volume of water for a poor result, in comparison of what well trained FF are able to do. \nJust an exemple: to enter a house, cool the hot gases, go to the room in fire and perform a complete attack against a 10x10feets room, with good instruction, it take about 4 minutes and about 50 gallons of water.\nIf your FF are able to do that, small vehicles are a good choice.\nIn 2007, I was instructing belgium FF. One of them tell me they face two fires, one before the course, the other after. The first one needed about more than 10.000 gallons of water, about 10 trucks and hours of job. The second one, same kind of house, same fire, needed less than 100 gallons of water, just one team and one truck.\nBuying vehicles is the key if instruction is OK. \nIn a few days, we will release an article on our web site http://www.tantad.com , about an attack of a fiercy fire in Belgium (proud to say the guys are my students!!): a fuly involved room, with flames of about 15 feets by the window. 4 volunters, time between stoppin the trucks and full extinction: 3 min and 20 sec, with one nozzle and 20 gallons of water. Budget?\nBest regards\nPierre-Louis\n\n\nHi,\n\nWorking as structural firefighting expert for years, intructing flashover instructor all around the world, I'm sometimes asked for such a question (Im French, so poor english level! :)  ).

      "text": "\n\nLeonard, I've just a little story for you. A few month ago, a commercial team, selling CAFS, was in Brasil for trying to sell such a system to military FF. They put the fire on a pack of fuel, and tell FF to extinguish using plain water. After that, they perform the same test, with CAFS and, of course, use less water. \nThey were thinking that the test was over, when a little and pretty women, FF officier, tells us to re-ignite. She took an \"ordinary\" nozzle, using plain water and extinguish the fire with less water than the CAFS... \nThis officier takes our Eureopean flashover instructor course a few mont before. \nWe've made many test about CAFS in structural firefighting. The result are not very good if, in front of that, you know how to use a nozzle. \nIn Europe, the Promesis test has been made 4 years ago and was sponsored by CAFS company. They made more than 100 structural burns. 3 years after the end of the test, the result are not public and the guy who start the test as employee of the CAFS company, is now founding it's own company, to create.... plain water nozzle. \nThe main problem is that you compare use of CAFS with FF flowing water just to turn home in swimming pool area. If you compare seriously, you'll see the benefit is not so important. \nBest regards \nPierre-Louis\n\n\nLeonard, I've just a little story for you.
