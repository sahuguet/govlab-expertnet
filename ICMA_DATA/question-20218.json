      "text": "\n\nHi Leslye:\nI have looked into some of the better options amongst the services similar to Constant Contact which are worth considering for your local government, and have included them here with a short review of each.\n1) Real Magnet (http://www.realmagnet.com/): Many reviews online basically boil down to a service that  costs a bit more than some of the competition, but also offering unique features like offering RSS Feeds or Fax versions of an eNewsletter.  Worth checking out.\n2) MailChimp (http://www.mailchimp.com/): A very popular choice with some very big name organizations (Intel, Canon, and Staples to name just a few), this is a comparatively cheaper option offering a lot of utility \u2013 they seamlessly offer HTML- and text only-eNewsletters, and with all of them allow you to track statistics with ease, to see how many of the emails were opened, how many embedded links were clicked, and so forth.\n3) JangoMail (https://www.jangomail.com/): This service is best-known for their offer of 24 hours per day customer service, as well as a very high-end HTML editor as part of the software, thus making it extremely easy to get a fairly complex eNewsletter together without problems.\n4) AWeber (http://www.aweber.com/): This is a very strong offering if your local government is interested in closely integrating the eNewsletter with blog and other social media content.  Also, they offer a  very easy-to-use storage system for previous eNewsletters as well, making them available to anyone who might need them after the fact.\nBeyond these software options, it is important to note that a simple in-house template will allow you to get the job done and get the newsletter out, but the HTML components will be much more difficult, and the amount of additional features and statistics-gathering provided by many of these services could prove invaluable.  The wonderful thing about the stat-tracking is that it serves as an indication of how worthwhile the service really is, thus enabling an informed decision about keeping or discontinuing the service.\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Leslye:\n\nI have looked into some of the better options amongst the services similar to Constant Contact which are worth considering for your local government, and have included them here with a short review of each.\n\n1) Real Magnet (http://www.realmagnet.com/): Many reviews online basically boil down to a service that  costs a bit more than some of the competition, but also offering unique features like offering RSS Feeds or Fax versions of an eNewsletter.

  "text": "\n\nAt the City of Concord, CA we are transitioning from a print employee newsletter to an eNewsletter. We're looking for samples of other online employee newsletters and information about how you create your newsletter - for instance, do you use an in-house template, or a service like Constant Contact? Thanks for your help.\nLeslye Asera, Community Relations Manager, lasera@ci.concord.ca.us\n\n",
