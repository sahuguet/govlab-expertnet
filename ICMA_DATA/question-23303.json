      "text": "\n\nEmily, \nAre you planning on leveraging these health assessments to directly or indirectly lower costs? Meaning, is your health provider providing a discounted rate quote if X# or Y% complete a health assessment? Or are you banking on the hope that members being more involved in their wellness will\u2014over time\u2014lead to lower and fewer claims, which would increase your overall annual premium? \nDo you provide HRA/HSA money? If so you could conditionally incentivize that annual benefit by requiring participation in health assessments. My previous employer used to have \u201cwellness credits.\u201d These were two 30-minute blocks of time weekly any employee could use to work out in the on-site gym while on the clock. Our health provided also gave us a modest \u201cwellness account\u201d we could use for employee wellness activities. From this account we purchased yoga balls employees could use at their desk, had free after work aerobics/Zoomba/yoga classes, and even paid for rounds of golf if the employees walked. \nHowever, I\u2019d caution against only using on-site health assessments as a lot of people are sensitive about their health issues and aren\u2019t keen on being weighed and measured in front of their coworkers. So providing a waiver that their doctor can sign saying the employee received their annual (free) physical, would be highly recommended. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions and I hope this helps.\n\n\nEmily, \n\nAre you planning on leveraging these health assessments to directly or indirectly lower costs?

      "text": "\n\nHi Emily,\nWe went through a similar situation a few years ago when we switched insurance plans that for the first time had a deductible.  We still make employees and their spouses (if on our plan) attend a meeting each year and then do some other type of activity throughout the year to receive HSA money the City gives the employee each year.  A few years ago we used the health screening as one of our events and really found it to be somewhat of a logistical mess and, as Mr. Munger mentions; many employees are very sensitive about what health info we may get as a result of the screenings.  Other ideas we have tried are tours of our recreation center so they can see all of the programs and equipment offered (we give free memberships to our employees and their families), come to a Health Fair we do each spring, have a preventative exam by their physician and doing an online wellness survey.  We have had mixed results with all of them, but average about 70% participation in most of them.  It really is an easy way to get the HSA contribution and we always limit it to no more than 1-hour.\nWe run a separate Wellness Program throughout the year that has decent participation.  As part of that program, we do Lunch-N-Learn events that are usually very informative and well attended.  I am not sure if that would be an option for you over the assessments.  I'd be happy to give you additional information if you're interested.  Good luck!\n\n\nHi Emily,\n\nWe went through a similar situation a few years ago when we switched insurance plans that for the first time had a deductible.

  "text": "\n\nWe are starting a wellness program, and our first goal is to have all employees complete a certain task (health assessment, etc.) in order to get our insurance rate down.  This will be mandatory completion, but we are not allowed to do the following this first year: (1) have a negative incentive for non-completion, (2) provide them a cash bonus for completion, or (3) give them time off for completion.  In the past, we have not made this mandatory and have given \"prizes\" (water bottles, free gym membership, etc.) for completion, with only moderate success.  Does anyone have any other incentives they are utilizing with a good success rate?\n\n",
