Tests has been made many years ago.\nI think the US fire service problem came from some details following each other. In 1973, due to the Arab/Israel war, we (European) have had to face a petrol crisis. Quickly we  added a high level of isolation in houses. As FF, we started to face very strange fires, producing a high volume of smoke and waiting for the FF to open. The Sweedish FF were facing also these strange fire and in all Europe, researchs were made and, time after time we changed our way of doing. We change our solide bore nozzle to fog nozzle and learn to use them in a very different way.\nAt the same time, USA was not facing such a crisis, as you have petrol. So, no need to isolate houses, no need to change the way to fight the fire as the stayed the same.\nWith the 9/11 event , US FF were viewed as heros and it was easy to give them money. Also, as the money for US FF seems to be calculated according to the value of houses, and as, at this time, prices were hight, the Fire service had plently of money. We are human: named heros, money as much as you want and no change in structural fire. Why changing? And why do we have to search? Everythings OK and the only things to do was buying tools, commercial teams claimed to be better than the best of previous month.\nAs the same time, in Europe, we were facing decrease in buget, increasing of isolated houses and so on. In Belgium for example, \"3 glass windows\" are numerous, roof with about 2 feet of isolation product and so on.\nWhat happened today is that, in a very short time, you face all the problems which happened to us in 25 years: the contruction crisis lower quickly the budget for fire service, people start to isolate their house, fire are changing and so on.\nThe US fireighting community is unable to give you feedback because I think they are just surprised by what's happening. Just take you car, go to the nearest fire station and tell the guy \"I suggest than you can fight the fire with fog nozzle, using small burst of water\". They will all reply \"No, it don't work\". \nThe only way is to demonstrate. Even in Europe, when we  speak of that with other European people who don't believe it works, the only way is to demonstrate.\nNext week, I'll be in france for 3 burns in an appartement to proove it works.
