Committee members may  participate in meetings via phone, skype, or other types of electronic conferencing.   Highlights of the rules include  a stipulation that committee  members must be present for an entire agenda item in order to vote.  Members are not allowed to participate in executive sessions because of confidentiality concerns when someone is connecting remotely.  If you would like a copy of our policy let me know.

  "text": "\n\nCounty Board Supervisors are asking to attend Committee meetings remotely, via, skype, face-time, etc., and be paid their per-diem.  My questions are:\n1.  Does your municipality allow this and what are the controls?\n2.  If allowed, was the mechanism by ordinance or resoltuion or policy or past-practice?\n3.  How did you answer the inevitable question then of allowing or not allowing employees to tele-commute?\n4.  If allowed by your municipaltiy how's it working?  Pros/cons......\nThank you and my direct email address is jeff.french@co.barron.wi.us\n\n",
