  "text": "\n\nI would like to know if there are any Cities that have developed a proactive partnership with local business in an effort to increase overall sales within their community. I realize that various Chambers of Commerce, Convention and Tourism Bureau's exist.

New approaches ideas would be appreciated.\n\n",
