  "text": "\n\nBroward County, FL is in the midst of a transition into an Enterprise Resource Planning project, meaning within the next few years all of the agencies\u2019 systems will have some level of integration. The Office of Management in Budget is considering using this time to evaluate some of our processes and policies to see if they are too restrictive or permissive compared to other entities. \nRight now, we generally have object code control, meaning that each line item\u2014generally\u2014are not allowed to be overspent. This means divisions, departments, and our office are frequently making transfers from one line item to another to keep each agency within its appropriation. Other counties I have contacted have \u201cappropriation group\u201d control, meaning that each division has categories of line items (personal services, operating expenses, capital, debt service, etc.). As long as these groups are whole at year-end, the individual line items can be over spent. \nAdditionally, we have thresholds for transfer amounts or dollar ranges that trigger increasing levels of approval\u2014from the division level, to the department level, to the OMB level. \nSo my questions:\n-At what level do different entities enforce expenditure control? Line item, \u201cappropriation group,\u201d division, department, fund? \n-What are your policies for budget transfers not requiring board/council action? \nThanks in advance.\n\n",
