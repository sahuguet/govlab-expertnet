      "text": "\n\nThe City of Cartersville (pop 20,000; 350 employees) holds monthly \"performance review\" meetings to review each department's performance metrics.  The meeting includes the City Manager and all of the department heads (occasionally, other \"upper level\" staff will be in attendance as well).  Each department has a performance dashboard page which is projected on the wall for everyone to see.  Departments take turns discussing their metrics making note of trends and progress towards goals (which are set at the beginning of the fiscal year).  Finally, department heads are given a chance to discuss department \"highlights\" from the previous month - these range from special accomplishments that aren't captured in the metrics to recent challenges that they have been facing.\nWhile there are certainly times when meaningful discussion and questions are sparse, we have had several good conversations arise from these meetings.  Often times departments seem isolated from one another and this meeting helps improve interdepartmental awareness.  Further, it promotes interdepartmental accountability.  We've also had a few instances where department x was having a problem and department y was able to help them out in some way.  Typically, questions are posed by the City Manager or other Administration staff - however, sometimes we get a question from a fellow department head.\nThe data that is reviewed is the same each month, and the departments are required to submit it at least a week prior to the performance review meeting.  The data is compiled into the performance dashboard which is distributed to all department heads prior to the meeting.  This gives them a chance to review the data and prepare for the meeting.\nI think you were smart to focus on your board's goals.  It should help the departments better understand that their contributions are important to meeting the overall goals of the County.\nI hope this information is helpful.  If you have follow up questions, please feel free to ask.  Good luck and let us know how it goes!\n\n\nThe City of Cartersville (pop 20,000; 350 employees) holds monthly \"performance review\" meetings to review each department's performance metrics.

Department's input their performance data into an internally developed system and the budget office prepares a report that highlights performance for all departments' key measures.  Three or four department heads attend and present their key measures.  We rotate which departments so a department is going before the City Manager about every 18 months.  After the dpeartment heads have talked about what they are doing related to performance the budget office then goes over the other departments highlighting any significant changes.  Generally the ACMs follow-up with the departments that are seeing a decline in performance.  We also have a quarterly report to the City Council on their priorities that highlights one or two of their priorities and then a year-end report that is more comprehensive.

  "text": "\n\nDakota County, MN recently established a set of about 40 performance measures that support the Board's 5 goals adopted in 2011.  We plan on starting performance meetings, probably occurring quarterly, to review measures with respective divisions/departments and talk about trends, supporting performance measures, and possible solutions to issues raised.  This is similar to a CitiStat idea, but will be less frequent, and many of our programs and measures do not have the immediate data/feedback that municipal departments do.  We are in the early stages of planning our first discussion meeting and trying to determine how many people to involve, how much data to request from the departments, and the format of the discussion. \nIf anyone holds similar meetings, can you provide your format, who is invited, questions asked, and data requested ahead of time?  We're especially interested in counties, but will take advice from anyone. Thanks!\n\n",
