      "text": "\n\nHi Patrick, \nI was able to find an ordinance from Hillsborough County where in section 32 you can learn how their county health department deals with the sale. It appears that that a small pet pig is sold there must be a notice posted of the bill of sale and there are also fines for the failure to post notice on the sale of a pig ranging from $50 to MCA. The document that touches on that they do when such a pig is impounded by the Department of Animal Services. \nicma.org/Documents/Document/Document/12749\nI hope this document is able to provide the information you are looking for. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Patrick, \n\nI was able to find an ordinance from Hillsborough County where in section 32 you can learn how their county health department deals with the sale.
