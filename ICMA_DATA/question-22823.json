So what do you gain by preferring local vendors and what do you lose when others do likewise and direct that against you? Good luck quantifiying that.\n\n\nA few years back we walked our council through the impacts of a \"local preference\" -- so on the plus side we talked about multipliers and how fast money might \"leave\" our local economy (probably faster than most local economies because of the nature of where we are and how big we are) -- how much more economic activity is generated by locally dollars being recycled before leaving our economy with local preference vs what happens when the first dollars leave almost immediately . . . on the minus side we talked about what happens to our own local economy should other jurisdictions enact local preference practices to deprive our locals of the same opportunity they might have today to compete on the same level as THEIR locals (what if a notion of reciprocity takes hold of every local economy and local preferences begin to be widespread -- creating nearly medieval kinds of economic nodes?) and how dependent we are as a resort on other people's decisions to NOT spend their money locally.

      "text": "\n\nElliot - I'm not sure the size of the community you are looking at.  Ultimately, any analysis would have to first take a fairly accurate inventory of whether your community is a net exporter or importer of goods and services used by other municipal Governments.  If you are a net exporter, a buy local policy could have the reverse effect should the other communities adopt similar policies.  Next, the only buy local policies I've seen are ones where the preference is a few % points in cost - essentially to break ties.  Anything more than that essentially means that taxpayers are paying an artificially high price due to restriction in competition.  If the preference is small, outside companies may still be interested in competing and local companies have a slight edge - sort of a win win.\nAs for analysis tools - I'd select some typical service areas that Gov'ts contract out (janitorial, pest control, telephone, IT, landscaping), then survey the companies within your community that provide those services and ask if their customer bases include other communities and how much business is generated, then add up those $$s.  You can also take documentation from previous competitive procurements for your own community's services and see what the effect would have been had a preference been granted (adtl cost versus adtl employment in the local area).  You can last do a cost benefet analysis combining all factors.\nApologies for the long answer.\n\n\nElliot - I'm not sure the size of the community you are looking at.
