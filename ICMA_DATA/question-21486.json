  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance member is interested in learning the specific steps/structure local governments have taken to win voter approved ballot measure(s)?  For example:  What steps/actions does a City take to gain the support of voters to receive  a \u201cyes\u201d for the continuation of a local tax that supports various city services.  Not the legal/statutory steps, but rather, the organizational steps City staff and others take in putting together a ballot measure/item to help ensure voter approval?\nWhatever information/documentation you can share is appreciated!\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
