Such as, housing, social services, job training, and the like.  \nEugene has a robust, community centric program and would like to see what others are doing that will help expand this important work.  As well, Jon is pleased to share the efforts in place in Eugene to interested agencies.\nPlease send any information you have (documentation, web links, etc.) to me and I will combine the replies and share the findings.\nThank you for your time!\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
