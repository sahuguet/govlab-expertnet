  "text": "\n\nThe City of West St Paul, MN is undertaking a $30,000,000 reconstruction of its major  transportation corridor which is predominantly developed with small to large retail commercial/service businesses.   We will be updating our development plans/guidelines and developing some overlay zoning regulations to guide future redevelopment and growth.  I am interested in sending the RFQ for doing this work to qualified planning firms with an excellent track record.   Any suggestions?\n\n",
