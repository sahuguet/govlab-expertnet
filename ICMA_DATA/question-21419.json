  "text": "\n\nWe will soon be advertising for a Public Works crew member. In order to make sure we have the right candidate, we are considering doing a field or skills test. The test would cover things we would expect somebody to know the first day on the job.  The position would be responsible for roads, snowplowing, parks maintenance, etc. Water and Sewer would not be included. Has anybody done this recently; and, if so, could you share your testing requirements?\n\n",
