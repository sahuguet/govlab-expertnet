In these cases, firms relied on the state's department of Commerce, the Community College system and the University system, and several municipal services.  I'm actively involved with several of these firms.  Let me know if you'd like more information.  \nA good general resource that talks further about some of these technology-related \"impact sourcing\" initiatives is: http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Markets-IEEE-Press-ReadyNotes-ebook/dp/B00AY73H6S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410222069&sr=8-1&keywords=BPO+markets\n\n\nHi Laura,\nI have four different examples of small rural US communities partnering with technology firms that provided outsourcing services to the corporate market.

  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone have examples of Public Private Partnerships for smaller communities?  We are working with small communities in Jordan and would like to hear about examples of public private partnerships for smaller communities and on a limited scale.  It would be great to see some case studies and lessons learned  - especially from communities who were implementing their first partnership, privatising or outsourcing for the first time.  Thanks!\n\n",
