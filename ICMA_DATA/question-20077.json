If it is the former, I am unfamiliar with our hiring procedures and I will forward your question to our human resources department.  If you mean the latter, I would suggest, if you haven't done so, to do a search in the Knowledge Network for sample government documents or articles on the subject.\n\n\nLachanda...are you referring to the administrative component of ICMA (i.e. staff members like myself in terms of the hiring process)?

In those cases, I ensured that I: 1) asked for a copy of the policy, 2) reviewed the language pertaining to handling of the confidential material, 3) checked if the policy indicates whether credit worthiness or history is part of the decision making process, and 4) requested, and received, a copy of the report.  The company most often used was Experian.  I NEVER required a credit check when interviewing applicants for any position.  I don't think my credit history was used against me in hiring decisions.   I can see how some companies would do that, but I don't know why local government would bother.  In one instance when asked why the town required it, I was given the tried and true anaswer of \"We always did it\".  Hope this helps..\n\n\nDuring my career, several non-profits, a private school, and a few local government entities required credit checks as part of the employment process.

      "text": "\n\nI would never encourage such a policy, and if the idea is ever raised for the Housing Authority I chair, I'd make arguments at length and vote against it.  We do credit checks for incoming tenants, for obvious reasons... but if someone has bad credit, don't you think it would be nice for them to get a job and help rebuild their credit?  And credit scores are extremely complex... someone could have bad credit because they have too many credit cards with zero balance, or they refinanced a home too soon after purchase, or all other sorts of silliness.  I consider it no less personal and irrelevant than checking their marital history.  When I'm hiring someone, I want to know that they have good moral character, no criminal history, good employment references, and they can do the job.  Why punish someone for hitting a rough patch in their lives... haven't people with poor credit suffered enough just in getting to that unenviable position in life?  And the idea that someone with poor credit may embezzle or otherwise act unscrupulously is nothing short of discrimination as far as I'm concerned.  If someone has no criminal history, then I trust they are not criminals.  We all deserve that benefit of the doubt as good, upstanding citizens regardless of any financial troubles we may have encountered in our past.  Right now much of the nation is experiencing horrendous financial problems, and if credit scores were around in the 1930s I'm sure few would have passed that test.  People who are struggling or who have struggled deserve help and support, not ostracism.  Obviously I feel strongly on the issue, but I think so many of my fellow bureaucrats are quick to sanitize the issue and/or do it because it's always been done or because it sounds \"prudent,\" but it's really an issue of discrimination, and for lack of a better term, morality.  I strongly advise against it.\n\n\nI would never encourage such a policy, and if the idea is ever raised for the Housing Authority I chair, I'd make arguments at length and vote against it.
