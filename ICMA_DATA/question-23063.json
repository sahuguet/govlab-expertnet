  "text": "\n\nTrying to find the best solution for determining the backfill materials for small diameter potholes used for locating utilities in our roadways and for geotechnical drillings 6 to 8 inches in diameter. These holes in the subgrade are between 3 to 45 feet in depth. and generally in the 6 to 8 inch diameter size. Tried bentonite and that was a disaster. Thinking about 3/8 inch pea gravel. Does anyone have any research or experiance that worked well that they would share?\n\n",
