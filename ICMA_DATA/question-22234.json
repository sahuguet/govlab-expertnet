My experience taught me that the design stage is paramount and too often not given the priority standing it should.  One key under estimated ingredient to insist upon from the outset is to get a very clear, understandable picture of the reason and need for each project, and to make sure the scope meets the need.  Often time, so-called change orders during the process are not from unanticpated factors but, rather, because assurances are not made that the scope addresses the need.  The other lesson I learned to timeline and benchmark projects is to not be shy about checking out the experiences of other governments, especially in the region with similar or identical projects.  I hope this is of help.\n\n\nOnce so far in my career I have served as Director of Capital Projects for a county government with an annual funded CIP of $100 million.
