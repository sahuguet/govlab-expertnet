  "text": "\n\nOur City is looking to include reporting requirements as part of the City\u2019s conditions of approval for temporary use permits for recycle like events such as electronic waste collections to capture waste diversion information.  Does your city have similar conditions for reporting by applicants as part of its temporary use permit or similar process for these types of events? \nI\u2019m looking for sample conditions/requirements that other cities require of applicants as part of its permitting process. If you can provide me a link to your temporary use permit or similar process and/or share any experience or challenges your city has had on this type of condition, I would greatly appreciate hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n",
