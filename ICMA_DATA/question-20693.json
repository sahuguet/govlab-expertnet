Most of the plans I have come across intend to use amateur radio in times of crisis or natural disasters as a means of emergency communication when wireline, cell phones and other conventional means of communications fail. Unlike commercial systems, Amateur radio is not as dependent on terrestrial facilities that can fail. It is dispersed throughout a community without \"choke points\" such as cellular telephone sites that can be overloaded. I hope this document helps.\n\n\nAttached is an Emergency Communications Plan from Licking County, OH, which uses Amateur Radio Emergency Service.
