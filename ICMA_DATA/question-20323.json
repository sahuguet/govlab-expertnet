That's certainly one consideration.  Networking with local government folks in your area and through ICMA is your best bet.  I got my first Assistant's job via an informational interview with past ICMA President Don Borut many years ago.  Don knew a mananger who was looking for someone and referred me to him.  The upcoming ICMA conference should be a great place to meet and network with folks in your state and around the country.  If you can afford to go, it would be a great place to start. Much success to you.\n\n\nCharles\nCongratulations on completing your MPA and internship. You didn't say whehter or not you were flexible on traveling to a new city/state or not.

The responces I received could be summarized as following, obtain additional internships to develop the minimum threshold of experience, take an entry level job, or be willing to move to a very small community.  Many \"next-gen\" managers, myself included, have effectivly been costed out by managers with 20+ years expereince.  The advice which my current manager gave me and I will pass on to you is to keep searching and applying, it could take literally hundreds of applications to recive a responce, let alone a job in this economy. (FYI I live in Michigan, one of the hardest markets for anyone to find a job, I whole heartedly feel your frustrations.)\n\n\nI recently asked a very simmilar question which recived much responce.

      "text": "\n\nIt's tough to break into the chief executive rank.  The easiest and most common way is to take a management analyst position, then an Assistant to the Manager position, then maybe a directorate or assistant/deputy manager job, and finally break into the chief position.  I couldn't recommend short-circuiting that path by too much, since the MPA doesn't make you a good manager any more than a JD makes you a good lawyer.  At the entry-level MA job you can afford to be a little picky: do your research and find a really well-run larger community to get started in.  If you're lucky (and good), you may be able to stay there for several rungs of the ladder.  Alternatives include executive experience somewhere else (NPO, corporate), working for \"entry-level communities\" (i.e., with dysfunctional councils, limited services, small population, small salary, etc.), or coming up through a department (planning seems popular, although HR and Finance make sense too).  Good luck!!\n\n\nIt's tough to break into the chief executive rank.
