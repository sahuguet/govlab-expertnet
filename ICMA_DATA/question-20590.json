If you go to our online bookstore (icma.org/press), put the item number in the search box, and voila--you'll get a thorough description of each book. Hope that is helpful!\n\n\nLeigh, in case these two publications aren't on your radar, I can recommend two excellent ICMA resources: Effective Supervisory Practices (item 43345) and Human Resource Management (item 43250).

  "text": "\n\nWhen I took ICMA's Knowledge Assessment tool, I scored miserably low on Human Resources skills. This was no surprise to me since I am early in my career and I have never hired, officially supervised or fired anyone. I currently manage financial resources, but eventually I will be managing people too. Are there any recommendations on resources to start learning the basics of HR and supervising employees? Books, websites, forums...\nThanks,\nLeigh\n\n",
