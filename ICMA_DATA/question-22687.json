In addition, we'd also like any recommendations specific to MRSA prevention.\nAny guidance you can provide would be appreciated. \nThanks,\nKaren Garrett\nManagement and Government Information Center\nChinn Park Regional Library\n13065 Chinn Park Drive\nPrince William, VA 22192\nmagic2@pwcgov.org\n703-792-4880\n703-792-4612 fax\n\n",
