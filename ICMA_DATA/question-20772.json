If you're not familiar with the term, it's an MS Word feature that allows you to change, edit and comment on sections of a document while leaving the author the option of either accepting those changes, responding to them or rejecting them. Please see this tutorial on YouTube for a complete walk-through: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfrd_YcBdak\nThis is, to my knowledge, the best and most commonly practiced form of collaborative review using MS Word.

Good luck.\nDerek Johnson\n\n\nHi Nick,\n\nMost organizations use track changes to provide collaborative reviews of documents.
