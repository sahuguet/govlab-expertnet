I would visit your local city/county and ask them if they need help with research, reports, community meetings, and etc. This would help you create your own internship and allows you to interact with local government. If you have a full-time job and cannot go in during their hours you can try and get them to allow you to work on projects in your free time then email them the completed work. \nI currently do the internship work in my free time because I cannot find a full-time job that will allow me to get the experience. This process is slow but it is better than having no experience. \nGood luck\n\n\nNicole, I am faced with a similiar situation in obtaining experience.
