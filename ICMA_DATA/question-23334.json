      "text": "\n\nHi Michelle and Kasey,     \nThe pros of reverse auctions for services are the same as commodities - competition, achieving market value, and transparency. Where they differ is in how you set them up.    \nThe cons come from the challenges below:    \nInitially picking the wrong service to put out to reverse auction    \n Basing the award decision strictly on price (we recommend weighing price at 50% or less)    \n  Setting up the pricing spec that doesn\u2019t make for apples to apples bidding (i.e. flat monthly fee for cleaning vs. cost per sq. ft.)    \nReverse auctions for services have great results when you take the time to identify the right contracts and set the spec up properly.    \nHere are a few services that work well:     \n1. Janitorial Service    \n2. Pest Control Services    \n3.Landscaping Services    \nI would be happy to answer any other questions and provide you with real examples from North Carolina and across the USA. You can reach me via email andrew.clarkATebridgeglobal.com or via phone (502)714-5985.    \nHope that helps!    \nAndrew Clark    \nBusiness Strategy Manager    \neBridge Business Solutions    \nwww.ebridgeglobal.com\n\n\nHi Michelle and Kasey,     \n\nThe pros of reverse auctions for services are the same as commodities - competition, achieving market value, and transparency.

  "text": "\n\nA classmate and I are researching reverse auctions and would like to know of some governments' first-hand experience with them. Particularly, we are interested in reverse auctions of services as opposed to commodities. \n-What are the pros and cons of reverse auctions?\n-What should governments be mindful of in engaging in reverse auctions?\n-Can you cite any examples of clear successes or failures of reverse auctions of services?\n-Do you have any additional resources that may be helpful as we research this topic?\nAnd if anyone has North Carolina specific examples of any government use of reverse auctions, this would be much appreciated.\nThank you!\nMichelle & Kasey\n\n",
