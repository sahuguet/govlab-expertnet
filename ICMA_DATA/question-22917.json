In 2013, 32% report an 8-hour shift, and  56% report a 10/12 hour shift.  I hope this is useful.\n\n\nHi Monica,  \n\nThe results of both ICMA's 2012 and 2013 Police and Fire Personnel and Expenditures Surveys show that close to 75% of municipalities report that their police officers work a 40-hour week.

      "text": "\n\nBefore considering any schedule, the workload must be studied. One needs to know the workload demand first and then implement a schedule that deploys officers when they are needed. Essentially deployment should track workload with about a 60% average  committed rate and a 40% non-committed ratio. The schedule must be designed to allow this type of coverage.  \nThe Police Foundation study found that there were no differences in physical effects on officers between 8, 10 and 12 hour shifts and no impact on accidents , etc. It did find that officers prefer a 10 hour shift which is not surprising since it can result in more days off. \nFor more information on workload vs. deployment, see the white paper on the ICMA Center for Public Safety Management website.\n\n\nBefore considering any schedule, the workload must be studied.
