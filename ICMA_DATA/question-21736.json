  "text": "\n\nOne year ago I left the City of Salem and went to work for the State of Virginia. In Salem, I opened an ICMA account. I need to speak with someone so I can continue to keep money in the account without losing money now that I am no longer placing money into the account. I do however; have a new account with the state. I would like any advice I could receive. Thanks for your time.\nSincerely\nMark Shaw\n\n",
