      "text": "\n\nI've been in 3 communities all similar in size to Salisbury.  I keep the policy relatively simple - all media requests come to my office and if necessary I put them in touch with a department head who can provide more details if necessary.  I've never had to deal with much more than one daily newspaper, a few weeklies, and a small number of online publications.  There have been a few issues over time that garnered statewide/regional attention and the policy worked fine. The police department has their own policy but the only practical difference is to substitute Manager for Chief.\nIn a towns my size we never had the need to put the policy on paper and verbal reminders always worked.  You raise a good point and it may be worth penning a policy at some point.\n\n\nI've been in 3 communities all similar in size to Salisbury.
