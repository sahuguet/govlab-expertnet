The employee had to be within 1 year of retirement and were offered an early buyout option.  On the positive, this allowed us to not make significant cuts to the budgets or personnel beyond eliminating vacant positions.   Plus it created opportunities to realign staff with new duties and opportunities for advancement for some employees.  We had to take extra care an not be selective as to who was offered the buyouts and that it was open to all eligible employees.  On the negative side, this also meant that seasoned employees left.  Some of our public safety areas are still feeling the impact of the loss of trained staff.   Coupled with this, the State (of SC) was making changes to retirement which further encouraged people to retire.   So, it's a useful tool, but there can be unintend consequences - and cost - if employees with a lot of knowledge take the offer.\n\n\nThe City of Columbia did this in 09 when the economy was in such a bad shape and had followed what our state agencies were doing with early retirement buyouts.
