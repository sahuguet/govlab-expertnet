  "text": "\n\nHello,\nWe are in the process of changing our city-wide health and wellness program to encourage more participation, as it has remained rather flat the past few years.  One idea we are strongly considering is awarding \"health bucks\" for participating in certain activities such as routinely working out, walking/running groups, health screening, etc.  The \"bucks\" could then be redeemed for prizes such as gift cards, rounds of golf, apparel and possibly a personal day, HSA or deferred compensation contribution, etc.\nI am hoping other communities currently engaging in a similar program would be willing to share their program outline with us, specifically as it relates to earning/redeeming points and funding the program.\nThank you in advance.\n\n",
