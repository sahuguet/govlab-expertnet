Unfortunately, they did not know of a study using salaries as a function of population. The problem with this type of study is that it would be immensely complicated to handle all the variables involved (cost of living, jurisdictional size, benefits, etc.) and compare them in a logical way.\nI hope these documents offer you some help.

Unfortunately, not only does that mean drilling down into your data but also doing the same for any other jurisdictions. As a rule of thumb, it is typical for a local government to spend 75% to 80% of its General Fund on compensation (salaries and benefits) \u2013 in large part because other types of expenditures are steered by accounting standards to other funds: special revenue funds, internal service and enterprise funds, capital projects funds, debt funds. Every government does its own thing so what is handled in-house by staff versus what is contracted out varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. That makes comparisons concerning spending on compensation difficult.  \nAs a long-time reviewer of budgets, I cheated and looked at yours on-line. Your contract with the King County Sheriff and how you handle your fire services tend to skew your ability to easily compare with many jurisdictions. I\u2019d probably try to stick with jurisdictions in the Seattle area that may similarly contract out services that other jurisdictions provide with in-house staff.  \nAli points out the difficulties in adjusting for population. You also need to consider differences in service standards between jurisdictions and the composition of population. \nIf, by any chance, the real issue is comparability of salary and benefits rather than staffing levels, then you can benchmark key positions between your jurisdiction and others to see if you are spending more per employee rather than having more employees than others to provide a higher service standard than others (or are overstaffed).\n\n\nDuncan:\n\nThese are, on the surface, simple questions that spiral into deeper and deeper analyses to gain any reasonable comparability.

  "text": "\n\nOur Council has asked several questions regarding the amount of money we spend from the general fund on salaries. The first question related to what percentage of the entire general fund do we spend on salaries. The second question is a little trickier and that is what is salary cost per capita. While the per capita calculation is easy, our city has a much higher cost per capita than many others I looked at. \nI think there are probably factors that would cause this, B & O tax collection in finance, active Development department, in house GIS, high daytime population with a big mall, etc. Does anyone know of a study or paper that discusses salaries as a function of population and factors that may drive the need for more employees? Thanks.\n\n",
