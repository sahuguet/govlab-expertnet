  "text": "\n\nBarron County (B/C) is facing the situation in-which large mining and/or oil exploration concerns are prospecting and signing long term lease agreements with B/C citizens.  Specifically, the purpose of the lease is to extract large amounts of sand from hillsides to be processed into finished product which is then transported to an oil well site, typically, Texas or North Dakota and forced, fraced, into a horizontal oil well. The result is fracing extends the productive life of the oil well, in terms of years of production and oil quantity produced.  \nMy question is are there any other Counties or municipalities facing a situation similar to this?  If so, what are you doing about; zoning, road damage, quality of life issues, potentail environmental damage, citizen perception(s)?  Are you signing any type(s) of Developers Agreement with the mining companies and if so what are some attributes within these agreements?  \nA second question:  If anyone in your municipality has expertise in this area are you willing to talk with me and the Barron County Board of Supervisors to help us?  We would be looking to get an understanding of potential pit-falls to avoid.\n\n",
