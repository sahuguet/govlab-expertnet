If you notice that employees of particular departments seem less informed or engaged than employees in general (keep in mind that being involved in the budget process is not everyone's idea of a good time), maybe those particular department heads need to open up communication lines within their own areas.

Some of their comments are nicer than others, but it has been useful.  My sense is the employees like the face to face visits.  Am wondering if providing a document might be useful.\n\n\nYour approach is much more comprehensive than ours.

Current and recent efforts include open lunch and learn sessions during budget season, weekly \"Budget News\" briefs to our frequent contacts, posts to our intra-net site and review of our Budget-in-Brief document at New Employee Orientation. If your community uses another outreach effort or if you have an idea you haven't yet treid we would love to hear about it!  Thanks!\n\n",
