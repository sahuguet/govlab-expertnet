      "text": "\n\nThe city of Portland has been publishing the budget book online, in PDF format, for more than 10 years. During this time we have dramatically reduced the number of printed and bound copies, but have not eliminated hard copy entirely. Certainly public distribution of hard copy has been reduced, and internally staff generally refer to the version online more than hard copy. Furthermore, the internal budget manual is published exclusively online for all staff. The online budget book could be more interactive, with more internal hyperlinks for example. A fully interactive document would be a significant advancement, requiring a great deal of investment. One advantage would be formatting for screen display rather than paper, and graphics that link to underlying data sources or supporting documents. A well planned approach to document preparation is key. The distinction between content, structure, and format in web design is also useful.\n\n\nThe city of Portland has been publishing the budget book online, in PDF format, for more than 10 years.

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Mesa, AZ changed to CDs for outside entities at least five years ago.  We now only send out a handful of CDs for those who still request them and refer others to the internet.  Physical books continued to be produced for the City Council, Media and management.  This year the physical books were discontinued for the City Council and media at the request of the City Council.  We moved our City Council agendas to electronic format last year, so this was the next logical step.  Physical books are still produced for budget office staff, executive management and for viewing at our libraries.  Our on-line book is just a pdf version of the document.  We add bookmarks and hyperlinks, but we do not have any true interactive features.  Our on-line CIP book is posted as a whole document and as individual sections.  The sections have additional links to interactive maps and project status dashboards.\n\n\nThe City of Mesa, AZ changed to CDs for outside entities at least five years ago.
