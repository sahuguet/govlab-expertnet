  "text": "\n\nI am looking for good examples of youth sport partnership agreements. Our agreements are 23 years old, or older in some cases, and the community has changed considerably in that time period. I'd be interested to learn of any best practices (or things to avoid) regarding this topic.\nIn a nutshell, Weatherford is looking to provide organized youth sports by partnering with local youth sports associations. The current agreements only partner with one association per sport. This may be difficult to maintain as the event spaces are public parks and the current agreements \"lock down\" the use of the parks to only the association with a \"monopolized\" agreement. You can see the problem. At any rate, we are interested in replacing the current agreements with somehting that better represents our community in 2010. I appreciate all thoughts, ideas and comments.\n-RH\n\n",
