  "text": "\n\nI was curious to find out what some other organizations policies are in regards to bereavement leave? Our current policy allows for up to 40 hours of paid leave for \"immediate\" family members, and 4 hours for \"non-family.\" We have had some issues recently because \"immediate\" family doesn't technically include Aunts and Uncles and this has been an issue for some employees. Before we make any changes to our personnel manual I would like to see if our policies are in line with other organizations. Thanks!\n\n",
