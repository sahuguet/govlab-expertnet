I would also suggest that you contact the Center for Priority Based Budgeting , which uses a performance based budgeting process that can incorporate public participation.  I know that CPBB did such a project in the City of Cincinnati with a public engagement element.   You can find more information and contacts on the Center for Priority Based Budgeting at   http://icma.org/en/results/management_strategies/leading_practices/priority-based_budgeting       You could also contact Lea Erikson, Budget Director at the City of Cincinnati to learn more about their process.\n\n\nHi Bryan!

  "text": "\n\nMy name is Bryan and I am a graduate student working on my final project.  \nFor this project, I am interested in the equity and sustainability aspects of using citizen engagement in the municipal budget and priority setting process.  While I have found a fair amount of literature on the topic, I am having trouble identifying community survey data that may help identify which communities use a formalized citizen involved process.  Geographically, I want to focus my project on municipalities of a single state.  My intention is to focus on Massachusetts.   Does this data exist?\nI would appreciate any suggestions you may have.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",
