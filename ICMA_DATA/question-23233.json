  "text": "\n\nArlington County is seeking benchmarking information from jurisdictions using open office concepts, which may include extended telecommuting and hoteling arrangements.  The following information, to extent available, will be most beneficial for us.\n1) Did you choose to implement an open office layout for all or some of your staff?  If so, what where their job descriptions and is telework a component? If not adopted, what were your reasons?\n2) Did you create space standards per person, per position title, or retain private offices? \n3) What were the reactions of staff to the changes both short and long term?  Did you contract a change management consultant to aid in the transition and develop policies?  \nWould you be willing to share more information or discuss with our staff?  If so, please contact Michelle Congdon at (703) 228-7942 or mcongdon@arlingtonva.us. Thank you.\nShannon Flanagan-Watson\nAssistant County Manager\nArlington, VA\n\n",
