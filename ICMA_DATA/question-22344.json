If the interview is a short drive I have no expectation of reimbursement.  Also the jurisdiction may place a cap on expenses.  Given enough lead time and a degree of reasonableness, this shouldn't be a problem.\nInterview expenses are small dollar amounts considering the costs of hiring and retaining a manager.  It is even smaller given the size of the enterprise that you will be managing.  Not paying expenses tells me that I would really not be comfortable in that organization.\n\n\nI view payment of interview expenses as an indication of how serious the jurisdiction is about having an open process.

As you might expect, I have found that smaller communities are less likely to offer reimbursements, or may offer only partial reimbursement, or only after the first interview.  Although it was not mentioned, I also discovered on one occasion after the interviews that those coming in from out of state and/or a great distance were being compensated, while those from within the same state as the community were not compensated.\nAs for a standard, I have not really discovered any norm.  I would like to hear if anyone else has!\nAs an alternative, I have noticed that many communities are offering Skype (or other video-conferencing option), or the phone, as means for the first/initial interview, and even second inter-view in a process going for more than two interviews.  I have actually suggested this option when the community was too far away and was not paying.  I have found that most have been willing to accommodate this.  Of course, before any hiring decsion is made, an in-person interview is essential and needed for both sides.\nAn addition factor to keep in mind I suspect is the economic times.  As we all know, local government, like all branches of government, is in difficult fiscal times at the present; in addition, public scrutiny is really focused on how much governments are spending on anything related to public employee compensation (and, it would seem, by extension, anything related to any staff-related expenses).\nThis can be difficult decision.  We try so hard for an interview, and then are faced with the prospect of getting it but having to foot what could be a major expense as well.  For example, I have had offers to go for an interview that was across country and with 20 other candidates in competition.  Of course, judging by a strict probability standard, this does not seem wise, all things being equal.\n\n\nFrom my experience, it seems to depend on the distance between the candidate and interviewing community, and the size of the community as well.

If the local government is serious about considering candidates outside the area, then travel costs are a standard expense in the recruitment process.

It reinforces the positive nature of the recruitment process and is sometimes a factor in whether the candidate is able to attend.
