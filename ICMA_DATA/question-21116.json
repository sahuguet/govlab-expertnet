      "text": "\n\nKendal,\nYou\u2019ve asked the million dollar question.  Capacity limitations and treatment of clean water (generally) are the problems you want to control.  A critical distinction to share with the public is the obligation of government versus the property owner and the cost impact of contributing unmetered flow for both.  I have a recent example that may prove useful. \nThe engineering company I was working for was asked to help a wastewater utility authority which provided treatment for 13 communities in New Jersey prepare a presentation that could compare two alternative solutions to their capacity problem.  The utility was exceeding 80% of plant capacity during wet weather events and the State DEP was forcing them to prepare a wastewater management plan update to describe how they would expand their treatment plant capacity.  The utility wanted to offer an alternative to their 13 local governments which would have them remove stormwater surcharges, inflow and infiltration (I&I), and fats, oils and grease (FOG) from their catchment systems.  My assignment was to define the problems, explain the causes, outline responsible parties (government and customers), offer steps to achieve this objective, and provide a cost estimate to contrast with the price of a plant expansion.  This would be presented to the utility board and the thirteen communities individually.  \nThe contrast in the two approaches was this.  The cost to expand the treatment plant was approximately $37 million to be borne by all thirteen communities.  The cost to have the thirteen communities enforce their own ordinances, eliminate a combined sewer in a short section of interceptor, implement cleaning and grouting of known collection mains with major leaks, update their FOG enforcement program, increasing the frequency of televising mains to once annually to identify problems for repair, and offer incentives like rain barrels for stormwater capture, would have cost approximately $17 million. \nBy looking at the various community ordinances related to stormwater management, sump pump discharges and such, the majority were fairly comprehensive with only one being little to no use.  I suggested recommendations to standardize each community and propose a shared approach to enforcement.  Despite the comprehensive nature of their ordinances, the communities had other priorities for funding and did not earmark adequate budget to perform inspections, televising and mapping of mains or plan for regular repairs to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I).  The power point presentation did a review of all thirteen communities which gave credit to some and marching orders to others (if they chose to proceed).  The point I highlighted was that repairs to I&I would have long-term cost reduction benefits to the community since each interceptor was metered that led to the treatment plant.  Therefore, the return on investment varied from two to seven years. \nA decision on which course of action to take is still pending.  Good luck with this.\nBill Gilmore\nWilliam B.

  "text": "\n\nMy city would like to begin addressing the costly issue of unmetered water infiltrating the sanitary sewer.  Examples of this would be basement sump pumps, floor drains, condensate pumps, roof drains etc.  I am looking for advice on how other cities have approached this problem.  How did you encourage compliance?  Does anyone have a sample ordinance that they would share?\n\n",
