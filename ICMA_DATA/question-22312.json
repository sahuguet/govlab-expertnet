One helpful tool is to prepare a work plan that outlines all of the current and ongoing projects, the quarter in which the wrok will be done, and identify if/where there is any capacity.  If council wants to add items to the work plan, they must have the discussion about what is required by the goal/initiative/project, and how to make room for it in the work plan -- what can be taken off of the current plan, deferred to a later date, or decide not to add anything additional.  Not perfect, but it does help in the conversation.  Staff must also be careful not to give in and keep agreeing to do more and more, with fewer and fewer resources.\n\n\nI have worked with several councils on goal setting, and this is always an issue.
