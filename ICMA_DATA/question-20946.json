This document not only describes the policy they approved, but also the statistics from all the other jurisdictions they surveyed.\nhttp://bit.ly/gHzUs5 \nIn 2005, Yukon, Oklahoma was nominated for one of the ICMA Annual Awards for their public service/reserve fund sales tax. This program established a \u00be penny sales tax to fund an increase in employee salaries and a \u00bc penny sales tax increase for the reserve fund. \nhttp://bit.ly/gNnzpG \nAdditionally, I was able to locate an article called \u201cBenchmarking and Municipal Reserve Funds: Theory Versus Practice,\u201d that seems to at least offer some good information. I am not entirely sure what direction you plan on taking your research, so hopefully it is applicable.\nhttp://1.usa.gov/gSyyNV \nI hope these links are helpful in getting started on your research!\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Joshua,\n\nWhile I was uable to find many journal articles or books that would answer your question, I have been able to get a few primary documents and other articles related to your topic. \n\nTo begin, San Mateo County, CA recently updated their reserves policy, and while doing so conducted a survey of the policies in 18 counties and 5 cities in California.
