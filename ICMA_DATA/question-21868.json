I don't think the Town or City you are looking at should view that the Interim will save them any significant amount.\n\n\nI am serving as an interim town manager in Ma.

Although it doesn't attempt to specify salary levels, you might find Chapter 2 pretty relevant. It's called \"Put It in Writing: Terms of Agreement for the Acting Manager,\" and the discussion includes a model for negotiating terms of appointment. You can find it on ICMA's website at http://icma.org/en/icma/career_network/career_resources/acting_managers_handbook. It also occurs to me that the ICMA members who created the handbook (and are listed in the front matter of the publication) might be a good resource. Good luck!\n\n\nI'd like to alert you to a valuable ICMA publication that is available free, as a benefit of ICMA membership: The Acting Manager's Handbook.

  "text": "\n\nI am being considered for appointment as an interim manager for a city (pop: 10,000+) for up to 6 months. I have been asked to be prepared to discuss salary requirements.\nLikley the City Council would want to see some \"savings\" from what they were paying the prior City Manager. However, is there a \"rule of thumb\" or does anyone have any policies on how to set a salary for an interim manager?\nAny information will be most helpful.\nThank you.\n\n",
