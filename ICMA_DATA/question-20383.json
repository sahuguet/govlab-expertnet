I do not know of any cost benefit analysis done but I can tell you from an efficiency standpoint it was amazing.   Every council member, the attorney, manager and the assistant manager were provided a laptop with VPN connections so they could view the agenda and supporting documents from home.  Laptops were used at meetings and the only time a paper packet was prepared was for the press and a few interested parties from the public.  I couldn't answer questions about the transition because it was in place prior to my arrival but aside from the occasional minor computer glitch, we rarely had any problems.\n\n\nRandolph, New Jersey started doing this a few years ago.
