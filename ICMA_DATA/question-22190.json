      "text": "\n\nI agree that the answer to your question is complex.  However, if you have your fire department responding to emergency medical incidents then I submit that you are actually solving more problems than you are creating.  You'll always need fire protection and as the element of prevention and early warning/supression devices has evolved, catastrophic fires have been reduced.   The logic of \"watering down\" the capability of a fire department to manage both frequent and infrequent risks (think medical calls versus structural fires) isn't wise and most certainly would be a failure.  The problem lies in the fact that the \"fire department\" is incorrectly titled for its role in 2012.  Instead, think of your fire department as an all-hazard emergency service organization.  This group should be trained to handle all types of low-frequency, high-risk events that could plague a municipality.  I've heard the logic behind smaller vehicles/crews and find the practice unsafe and a waste.  Because we demand that our fire departments handle a large spectrum of problems and do so in a quick manner, we have to provide them with vehicles that do multiple jobs.  Fires are not common (thank heavens), but when encountered they put citizens and employees at risk and require human resources - many of them.  As a comparison, law enforcement officers may go an entire career without using their pistol in the line of duty.  However, because a worst case situation could arise we find it acceptable and logical for them to be equipped with such firepower.  \nIf you're looking to make your fire department more progressive, responsive, and accountable I'd suggest the following:\n1) Embrace emergency medicine and consider the transport component.  No one is better situation to help in life-threatening emergencies than properly trained firefighters in strategically-located fire stations.  Analyzing the need for basic versus advanced level care is worthwhile.  Many calls don't require paramedics.  However, the paramedics of today can do just about anything a hospital ER can do.  What a service to citizens to be able to provide life-saving interventions to their living room within minutes!\n2) Make sure your department understands that it is part of an all-hazards response team.  Hazardous chemicals and technical rescue situations have to be handled and your local team should be training to do so.  Challenge your fire department to look at ways to collaborate and coordinate with other municipalities to reduce start-up and on-going costs, when appropriate to do so.\n3) Insert your fire department into economic development.  Your fire department is going to be the agency that keeps commerce alive and minimizes impact to your tax base when disaster strikes.  Make sure those firefighters realize the indirect dividends of their performance.   Having an aggressive, properly equipped, and balanced fire department can mean the difference between a business closing for good, and reopening a few weeks after a fire.\n4) Make your fire department accountable by measuring performance metrics against industry standards.  Make them strive for accreditation and validate their perceived needs.  Fire trucks are expensive.  However, has your fire department justified why they need a $500k rig or adopted a formal replacement schedule for large apparatus?\n5) Establish a desired a level of performance.  Do you want fires to be contained to a bedroom or is it acceptable to just keep neighboring houses/structures from burning?  In my city the vast majority of fires (non-incendiary) are low cost remodels as opposed to reconstruction.  What do your taxpayers demand?  What can your city afford?  Design your fire department to match the outcome desired by elected officials and communicate that need to the fire chief.\n\n\nI agree that the answer to your question is complex.

Does it mean the team for structural fire is not the same than the team for vehicule fire? For both you must have the same equipement (breathing appartus in both case for ex.).\nYou must \"group\" all non EMS activity. Notice that this problem is typical from organisation in which firefighter are no paramedic. In France for ex. the \"sapeurs-pompiers\" are doing EMS and fire. So the cost is divided. And as non-EMS are only 20% of the whole activity, it's a good solution. As the FF are here \"in case of something\", you can't delete the \"structural fire\" problem. So I suggest to:\n1) ask the structural fire team to also fight against grass fire, vehicule fire, to do cacthing of cats in trees and so on.\n2) try to group EMS and firefighting within only one team.\nI'm working on the installation of volunter fire-station in Brasil and we study this problem for about 5 years. No other solution than to give the firefighter more and more things to do in order to not disminish the global cost, but to disminish the action cost as \"action cost = global cost/ number of actions\"\nBest regards\nPierre-Louis\n\n\nInteresting question but at the same time, there is one point I don't understand.

The time elements that follow are an attempt to position resources on the scene prior to the fire \"flashing over\" and eliminating possible survival of occupants. The factor most likely affecting the outcome is the amount of time from the point of ignition to the point that the alarm is raised; if flashover occurs and alerts people to sound the alarm, the chances of arriving before that point is \"0\".  Existing \"standards\" are to be used for evaluation purposes and are tactics for attempting to deploy resources at the scene of a fire.

The majority of EMS calls are of a basic life support nature (not advanced life support) and do not require the response that we send to every incident.\n\n\nI believe there is a considerable amount of interest.

  "text": "\n\nWe are a small residential community.  Our professional fire protection services are provided jointly among our neighboring communities.  Very high quality services.  We also have separate fee-for-service paramedic/ambulance services. \nThe challenge is, less than 1% of our calls are structure fires.  The vast majority are EMS, auto accidents, vehicle fires, etc.,  In essence, we are paying over $1.5M each year to maintain the capability to respond to those few structure fires.\nYour numbers are certainly different, but the issue may be the same:  we are rolling 3 people and a $500,000 rig numerous times a day for calls that don't need that level of response.  But if they didn't roll for all those non-structure fire calls, who would, and what would the firefighters do?\nIt just seems like the system has evolved in one direction and our needs are evolving in another direction.\nIf I am right, and many of us have the same challenge, how do we get lots of people to start thinking about solutions.  People in the fire service, in other areas of city government, and in other fields entirely.\nWould a wiki or an app, with some kind of psychic reward and maybe even a small monetary reward, stimulate people to start contributing ideas, ideas that could then jump start other ideas?  Do you think there is a high level of interest out there?\nIf there is, there must be a way to network a large number of good heads together, focusing on this issue, until we come up with some solutions.\n\n",
