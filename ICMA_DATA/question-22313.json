  "text": "\n\nOur local school district is considering consolidating K-12 in one campus to be more cost effective and sustainable (with a carbon neutral goal).  This will leave three to four buildings/sites as surplus and the district would like to recoup some of the cost of the consolidated campus facility through the sale or lease of the surplus properties.  Three of the sites are in residential areas, and the fourth is adjacent to a state highway and a residential neighborhood.  \nWe are seeking examples of school districts that re-purposed and redeveloped an existing school facility and/or site in a way that has benefited the adjacent area, the community and the school district.  \nIn particular, school officials are interested in examples involving either of the following please:  \n\nthe old facility or site or was/is repurposed/redeveloped using \u2018green\u2019 construction methods for either a public purpose or private purpose following sale. \nthe old facility was adaptively redeveloped into multi or single family housing involving a partnership between the school district and the developer.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
