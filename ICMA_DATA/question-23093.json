      "text": "\n\nHi, \nThank you for your question on handling news media who miss meetings and still want to be filled in. I was able to find an article that discusses the city manager's role in keeping the news media informed, although they specifically were discussing when media is critical of the local government. I hope you are able to find the answer given in the article useful. It might be possible to write up a single summary and sent that to all media outlets so the treatment is equal and you only need to respond once. \nicma.org/Documents/Document/Document/2513\nI hope other city managers and local government officials are able to chime in and provide you with first hand first hand experiences of how they deal with this issue ethically. \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi, \n\nThank you for your question on handling news media who miss meetings and still want to be filled in.

  "text": "\n\nWe have some news media outlets that seem to have difficulty, for whatever reason, attending our Board meetings; however, they also want us to discuss with them before or after a Board meeting what will be or has been discussed and/or acted upon.  We will be posting our meeting packets online beginning next meeting in an effort to help deal with this situation (and to provide information to the public, as well, of course); however, I'm sure they'll still want to go over what happened at the Board meeting afterwards.\nWhile we certainly don't have anything to hide, I also don't believe that's our/my job to give a detailed account of what happened just because the news media can't or doesn't want to attend our Board meetings.  Has anyone dealt with this kind of situation and, if so, how did you handle it?  Thanks in advance for your assistance.\n\n",
