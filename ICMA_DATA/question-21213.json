      "text": "\n\nThe City of Bellevue, WA, is actually in the process of re-contracting for these services right now.  Our printing contracts are currently structured as follows:\n\nWeb press printing for our city's quarterly newspaper, the parks program brochure, and a variety of other web press jobs is covered by one contract with a local printer.  The printer was chosen through a competitive process.\nOffset print services are covered by several separate contracts (4 if I'm remembering correctly) with a combination of offset printers and print brokers.  These printers were chosen through a competitive process, and essentially became a roster of providers from which staff can choose.\nOur in-house copy center, multi-functional devices, mail/courier services, and city hall central receiving and distribution were recruited through a third RFP.  (Coincidentally, we just finished the first round of vendor interviews this morning)  Presently, one vendor provides MFDs and copy center services, and another vendor provides mail/courier and central receiving/distribution.  We're not sure yet which direction we are going to go with the next contract, aside from keeping the copy center in-house.\n\nAs part of the current RFP, we requested information on alternative approaches to the copy center function.  I had expected to see more proposals come in touting the benefits of moving the operation off-site, but the off-site options were really limited.  This may have been because we still required vendors to provide an on-site presence due to customer expectations.\nPrior to moving into the RFP process, we started with an RFI.  There were some innovative concepts that came out of the RFI responses, particularly in the approach to MFDs.  Much has changed since the last time we went out to RFP, so it was a great opportunity to learn about what was new in the market (i.e. \"cloud\" printing - in quotes because the \"cloud\" is really just a print server in most cases).  For the most part, though, the RFI was a bit disappointing and turned into a product dog & pony show, which was what we were trying to avoid.\nIf you email me, I'd be happy to send you the RFI and RFP we used for our process.\nColin Walker\nCommunity Relations Coordinator\nBellevue Parks & Community Services\ncwalker@bellevuewa.gov | 425-452-7248\nA CAPRA Accredited Agency\n\n\nThe City of Bellevue, WA, is actually in the process of re-contracting for these services right now.
