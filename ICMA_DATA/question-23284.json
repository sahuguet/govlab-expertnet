We never inspected compliance on the residential side unless the ground was opened up in the right of way where downspouts were located, or if there were known issues/complaints causing the work order in the first place.  It sounds as if this would require a lot of resources for a larger city such as San Diego, however it may save a lot of headaches down the road.\nSeth\n\n\nHallie--\n\nFor what it's worth.

The City of Carlsbad has never formally inspected residential areas; only conducted outreach education and complaint response.  Are there other local jurisdictions that inspect/patrol residential areas for storm water regulation compliance and pollution prevention?\n\n",
