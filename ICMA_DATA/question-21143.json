      "text": "\n\nHi Kathy-\nThe City of Tracy has used an informal and formal RFP process for grant writing/consulting services.  The informal process was used for a specific program whereas the formal was geared towards the City and encompassed all departments.  Regardless of the process, the overall cost was the same whether there was a fee per grant written or hourly fee which included research, working with staff and writing the grant.   Attached for your use is the formal RFP issued by the City of Tracy two years ago.\n\n\nHi Kathy-\nThe City of Tracy has used an informal and formal RFP process for grant writing/consulting services.
