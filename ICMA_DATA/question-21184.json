Wayne county then refused to live up to the agreement and quit paying.  We went to court and reached a settlement.  I have or can get copies of the agreement and the settlement along with many other documents.  The issue was that the formula was tied to county growth in assessed valuation and the county felt that no one envisioned such an increase because of development in the western part of the county.  We settled on a fixed payment a year before the crash.  Wayne county is probably paying more now than under the original formula.  \nCall me with questions-- (989) 725-0568 or cellulat (989) 494-8407.\nEmail: donald.crawford@ci.owosso.mi.us.\n\n\nNever looked at this before but 317 were in my inbox.
