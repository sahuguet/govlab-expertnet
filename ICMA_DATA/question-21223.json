  "text": "\n\nA midsize community in Northern New York is looking for recommendations related to measuring staff proficiency in the Microsoft Office Suite, namely Excel and Word. We are looking to do this so we can have some sort of benchmark to gauge the skill level of new and current employees and assign those that need to training. Essentially, we want some sort of mechanism to help demonstrate proficiency and to judge what level of training is necessary (i.e. beginner, intermediate, advanced). Does anyone have experience with this, and if yes do you have sample evaluations you can share?\nThank you very much.\n\n",
