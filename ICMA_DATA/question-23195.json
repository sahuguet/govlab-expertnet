  "text": "\n\nthe City of Corpus Christi recently created a Vision and Strategies for Homeless Solutions. (Attached)  One of the strategies is to \"Develop zoning and other regulations that control the location and expansion of homeless shelters.:\" We currently allow homeless shelters in light industrial, but we have a number that are existing non-conforming uses in  residential areas. The City wants to limit shelters, and to disallow them in the downtown/uptown areas. Please share any zoning regulations you have in your community that will help us achieve our strategies. Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",
