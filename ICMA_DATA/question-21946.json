The system we are looking to acquire will work in partnership with our GIS/CMMS software system, allowing us to track the location of our fleet (real-time) in relation to our service requests and work orders.  \nPrior to implementing this fleet management GPS system, we will need to adopt clearly outlined policies and procedures. \nDoes anyone currently have a fleet management GPS system in place?  Would you be willing to share your policies and procedures with us to use as a framework for developing our own?\n\n",
