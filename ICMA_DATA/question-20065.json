Many jurisdictions currently operate such facilities. I also recommend calling Mesa, which is a member of CPM. I would also suggest you contact Oklahoma City, OK; Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Long Beach, CA. \nFor more information about the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement visit: www.icma.org/performance.\n\n\nMark, \nAs a part of the ICMA's Center for Performance Measurement's (CPM) fleet management performance survey, we ask each jurisdiction whether or not they own, operate, and maintain an alternative fuel filling facility.
