To begin, the city of Bothell, Washington was recently nominated for the Strategic Leadership and Governance Award for their Development Services Initiative. This initiative created a team that supervised the development review process for new building plans and reduced the time to obtain a permit from eight weeks to two weeks. I would suggest contacting that city government and I have put a link to their award nomination below:\nhttp://bit.ly/eCr6C7\nAlso, the town of Leesburg, Virginia was nominated in the same category for a program called Land Development Process Improvements. The process of getting approval for new projects was so lengthy that town leaders had to develop a way to streamline the process. Officials noticed that there was a severe disconnect in communication among the departments associated with the development process, and created a new system to fix these issues.\nhttp://bit.ly/fQYk6e\nI hope this helps!\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Elaine, \n\nI have found some documents that I think would be useful in answering your question.

This would involve examining all phases from the initial contact to the grand opening (site planning, zoning, design, contruction, permitting, building codes, etc.) to determine what worked well, what didn't, what could be learned.\n\n",
