By going this route it wasn't me asserting my authority, it was a neutral party simply going through council responsibilities v. manager responsibilities and the consequences for failing to abide by those.  I was a little lucky in that I had established this as a bi-annual process shortly after election when new members came on board.  I did this in addition to a packet of information on \"New Board Members FAQ and Responsibilities\".  It helped quite a bit by establishing boundaries and reaffirming who had what roles.\n\n\nI had this very situation in my last community where the Mayor and a council member (both former employees) decided to get involved in the \u201cadministrative affairs and staff\u201d and I addressed it by having council come in and go over again what the Charter stated relative to what their role was and how that translated into who did what and who was responsible to whom.

It appears that the mayor you describe needs to channel his or her energy into a constructive approach to leadership.  The key contributions of the mayor are to help shape a shared vision for the city and facilitate communication in three areas:  within the council, between the council and the manager, and between the community as a whole and city government.  This type of leadership entails that mayors respect the role of the manager as the executive of the organization as well as incorporating the views of other council members when they articulate their goals or speak for the city.  Mayors who step into administrative tasks in city hall are undercutting the city manager and at the same time distancing themselves from the council.  Thus, the two key leadership positions in city government are being weakened by the assertive mayor.  The model of political leaders that is widely held in the media and the public mind stresses that the mayor be \u201cin charge\u201d and exercise control.  In contrast, the literature on leadership in all kinds of organizations\u2014including city government--finds that collaborative approaches are preferred to authoritarian and power-based methods.  In addition to orientation, the roles of the mayor, council, and manager are important topics to be covered at a council retreat.  Discussion of the mayor\u2019s role and case studies of effective mayors are found in my book The Facilitative Leader in City Hall:  Reexamining the Scope and Contributions (Boca Raton, FL:  CRC Press, 2008).\n\n\nActive mayors are an asset when they provide leadership to and for the council.

I have an active Mayor and a council member who is concern that the Mayor is overstepping his authority.  I am a firm believer that part of Councils\u2019 responsibility is to correct or hold each other accountable.  Do you have any suggestions that come from similar situations?\n\n",
