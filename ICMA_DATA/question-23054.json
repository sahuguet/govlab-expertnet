I would like to recieve the cost-per-student estimate forCDL drive test preparation training based on 48 hours. Include your hourly wage, training vehicle/equipment cost and any other costs that may apply to an internal program. I would also like to obtain the salary of the employee completing the training. How many employees require a CDL license, how many employees are trained each FY.  What is the hourly wage paid to CDL A, B and C employees and is this comparable to private sector salaries in you city?  If you train internal, do you require employees to sign a letter of commitment for employment for a certain period of time?
