  "text": "\n\nUnder current state and federal legislation, approximately 80 percent of Assets Forfeiture funding confiscated via illegal narcotics traffic and other criminal enterprise is diverted back to law enforcement.  I completely understand and appreciate the necessity for law enforcement personnel to be equipped with the requisite equipment and technology to disrupt and reduce crime, but consider if even a minute percentage of the aforementioned funds were allocated for early childhood education, parenting classes, recreation, prevention, and afterschool programming.  Imagine if local businesses and corporations matched illegal forfeiture dollars that were being reinvested to support and grow infrastructure and vital programming for families.  \nWhat is your take on the above?\nI have attached a letter to our local newspaper, the Rochester Democarat and Chronicle.\n\n",
