As a result, we are looking for other communities definition of \"Family\" that would stand up to legal challenges.  \nOur prior definition read as follows:\n\"Family -- a single individual living upon the premises as a seperate housekeeping unit, or a collective body of two or more adult persons related by blood, marriage or legal adoption, or not more than two adult persons not so related, living togehter in a single dwelling unit as a single housekeeping unit.\"\nI would appreciate any definitions of \"Family\" that have been updated and/or withstood a court challenge.
