  "text": "\n\nThe Village of Jonesville is in the final stages of incorporation as a Home Rule City in Michigan. Consequently, we will have to take on the added service of Assessing. Our plan is to contract for assessing services. I was looking to see if any Michigan managers have an RFP for Assessing services that they might be willing to share. Based on our S.E.V. we will require someone with Level 2 assessing certification or MCAO as it is called. If anyone has a good rfp could you please send it my way? Thanks very much in advance!\n\n",
