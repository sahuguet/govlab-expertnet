The fundamental problem you raise is you don't have top management commitment and/or even understanding the value of what you're doing.  My suggestions would be as follows:\n1. Provide more info and education to the top management team along with providing them links to other City sites already using metrics - this starts to develop knowledge.\n2. Provide them the case (elevator speech) of What are we doing, Why are we doing it, What do you expect out of them, and What's in it for them.  It's all about realizing that this has a direct benefit to top management.\n3. If top management doesn't know and doesn't want to know, then you're working to develop metrics that your peers realize are valuable to them for the same reasons (elevator speech).  It's always best for the Mayor or City Manager to clearly set expectations for metrics and then seriously follow through to make sure it happens.\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you're dong the right things, without management \"getting it\" and your ability to keep your peers engaged in the value of metrics is slumping, it makes no sense to whine about it, just decide if you want to continue to be in this environment or move on to a better situation with better management.\nWe always find that Leadership is the key.  Good leadership causes great things to happen.

Then PM's measure progress towards results that folks care about.\nSets: There is no one perfect KPI. We use clusters, or sets, of PM's around each outcome to create a more nuanced and balanced perspective.\nRelevance: Annual performance reports are necessary for continuity and transparency, but usually most interesting to the analyst types. It's hard for managers and electeds to relate these to the burning issues of their day. Weave relevant PM's into the analysis of current topics. Make the PM's relevant to the issues that decision makers are facing. For example, we report on the cost recovery rate of recreation programs. Mildly interesting by itself. But when faced with budget cuts, we included cost recovery performance in the budget program analysis of cut options, both in issue papers and presentations to the budget advisory committee. Then this performance measure became exceedingly relevant.

Sometimes, performance measurement is focused on the \"outputs\" -- number of permits issued, number of purchase orders processed, number of potholes filled -- and not the larger goals of permit streamlining, customer satisfaction, or pavement quality.  The strategic plan might be a great starting place for determining which measures will capture the interest of management, elected officials and the public.\nAmong the strategies that have worked for some Center for Performance Measurement participants are to set regular meetings with departments to consider how they're performing, and to consider performance data in the before/after discussions of any budget cuts or additions.  This helps to show where rosy expectations from a proposed action may not have panned out, or where there may be unintended consequences as well.\nFrom the public's perspective, you might also want to consider what their patience is with the detailed data being collected.  Where you can summarize the findings to a few key points and tell them what it means, they're more likely to engage in the discussion.  On library services for example, knowing about changes in hours, materials acquisition expenditures, and wait-time for new releases may tell many patrons what they want to know, even though you may track much more than that internally (and have the data ready for when the discussion gets more specific).\nAnother great step is to find that one champion who \"gets it.\"  That may be a department head, budget analyst, or just someone pushing for their own pet project.  Support them in making their case with data, and others will take their lead.\nJurisdictions that have done well at managing their performance programs are linked at the bottom of the CPM Certificate page:  http://icma.org/en/results/center_for_performance_measurement/services_and_publications/certificate_program.\n\n\nOutcomes are certainly a key consideration.

It's been very methodically done \u2013 with lots of staff support from within the organization.  The issue now is leadership (elected, top staff leadership)  and the lack of support and frankly, accountability.  I am not being held accountable for the work I am doing citywide, and certainly not department heads.  \nWe are still in the very infant stages of our initiative and have a ways to go but without this just basic support, encouragement and challenge, I feel like I am beating my head against the wall and doing it only for me.   And, staff that have been behind me are starting to fall off (they have not said this to me, but discussions around \u201ccredibility\u201d have started coming up\u2026..).  The organization was different when this initiative started, too.  Things change\u2026\u2026and I wish we had been farther along when the change occurred, but that has not been the case.\nWhat advice do others have who have found themselves in this same situation?\n\n",
