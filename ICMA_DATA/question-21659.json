  "text": "\n\nThe City of Painesville, Ohio is looking for Zoning Ordinances that include a Boutique Inn / Hotel which would allow more than the typical 3-5 rooms of a Bed & Breakfast and also provides the ability to serve more than breakfast in residential areas (multi-family zoned areas = R-2) of the community. We are looking for City Ordinances that define a Boutique Inn/Hotel.  In addition to the 10-20 suites, it may also permit a public restaurant, a boutique, a wine tasting room, a room to host small parties (possibly weddings receptions), etc. that would also be open to the public. \nThe City has a 144 year old building \u2013 Steele Mansion (www.facebook.com/pages/The-Steele-Mansion/213024515402260) \u2013 that is located in a historic district of the community and they would like to have 15-20 individual suites which is not permitted via our ordinance. We are looking for other ordinances that create a permitted or conditional use in their code for a Boutique Inn / Hotel with definition and the zoning districts in which it is permitted. \nAny assistance and/or direction you could provide would be greatly appreciated.  We are open to other ideas as well.  \nDouglas L. Lewis\nCity of Painesville\nE-mail:  dlewis@painesville.com\n\n",
