  "text": "\n\nI wanted to ask some guidance from more \"seasoned\" professionals if they have ever participated in the creation of a foundation/non-profit.\nA bit of background: I currently work for a 501 c6 and we are working towards more involvement with outreach to populations such as young adults/ military/other vulnerable populations to provide them with tools to spend money wisely and resources when issues arise. All of the funding comes from our c6 budget, which is very constrained since we are still growing locally.  \nI want to get the ball rolling on establishing our foundation with a 3-5 year plan.  I have an idea of where to start but what are some areas that I should focus on? If you have experience in the area of c3 non-profits, what were some of your challenges for growth and leveraging donors? \nAny and all input is greatly appreciated!\n\n",
