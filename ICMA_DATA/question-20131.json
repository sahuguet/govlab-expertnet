(Upload your profile picture. Questions that have a picture of a real human being [or meerkat] next to it tend to get more answers)\nBe clear in the title (writing \"Sample Proposals for Closing Streets to Pedestrians Only\"  might get you fewer answers than \"Walking Districts\" but the answers will probably be more accurate/helpful)\nWrite like a reporter (Newspapers use the inverted pyramid style when writing. This means the most important information is at the top and the details are at the bottom of the story - just in case the editor needs to cut for space. In the \"question\" section, write the question in one or two sentences first; then fill in the details. People will only see the first few lines of the question section when skimming through the questions tab)\nDemand like an editor (Newspaper editors are known for pushing tight deadlines - if you have a question and need a timely answer, don't be afraid to use the deadline feature below)\nLink it (If you're referring to a document or program, assume that readers don't know everything; include links to the page or attach a document using the uploading function below. Also be sure to include as many topics as you think apply. This way, you're question will also show up in relevant topic pages. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/topics. <- See! Even Meerkats link)\n\n\n",
