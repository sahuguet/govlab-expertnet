  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance member and new AZ Town (April 2010), is looking for information re: housing trusts or authorities.  This is unique in that that all housing is employer owned. The top issue that voters care about is how to be able to rent or buy a place to live that is not owned by the employers.\nThe town hopes to acquire 40 acres and set up a housing trust or authority and is looking for existing models.  They want to do partnerships with private sector to build and rent apartments and homes that residents can buy or rent. \nAny advice, help, documentation you can provide is appreciated!\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
