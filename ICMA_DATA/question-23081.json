  "text": "\n\nThe City was approached by a community non-profit interested in using a small, undeveloped island in the river as a passive recreation site. The City requested the organization to provide a concept plan for review. The City is developing a draft lease/use agreement for consideration. \n\nThe City is seeking examples of lease or use agreements that provide for the lease of a city-owned island to a non-profit for use and or development as a passive recreation facility.\nI am interested in any past experiences other managers or organizations encountered in like or similar situations.\n\nYou time and thoughts are appreciated.\n\n",
