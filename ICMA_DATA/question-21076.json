      "text": "\n\nHey Jimmy, \nI went straight from undergrad to grad school and graduated without experience and now I am having trouble breaking in because of my lack of experience. My advice to you during grad school would be do whatever you can to obtain experience such as volunteer, internship, low level entry position and go above and beyond by asking for more duties. Tell them you will do anything such as write letters, research, attend meetings, anything that will allow you to obtain direct experience. \nFor the past 6 months I have been volunteer at a local city assisting with grants, writing letters, and working on various projects. My arrangement is the city emails me work and I email it back. I show up once every other week to talk in person but most of my work is done on my own time. If you are able, spend time at the city offices and work along side everyone to have face to face contact. \nI hope this has helped and good luck, \nDavid\n\n\nHey Jimmy, \n\nI went straight from undergrad to grad school and graduated without experience and now I am having trouble breaking in because of my lack of experience.

Most applicants have little to no experience in local government. Since 2004, we now have six program alumni that are town and city managers; many more who are assistants or in other senior positions.  Also, do as much as you can while in your graduate program to build connections and work for communities either  during a summer, or while you're in school. Even when looking for government work, connections and networking is key to obtaining the first job and advancing in the field.\n\n\nYou should also investigate post-graduate management internships, like the Local Government Management Fellowship (and others directly sponsored by a local government), once you are finished with your MPA.

      "text": "\n\nGreetings Jimmy.  I can only speak of my own experience.  I began my MPA shortly after taking my first local government job as an elections technician.  Cut to 7+ years later.  I am still in elections, although in a managerial capacity.  I am having a very difficult time making the switch from elections to general city/county management.  So experience is important, but relevant experience is even better.  Hope that helps.\n\n\nGreetings Jimmy.  I can only speak of my own experience.

  "text": "\n\nHello everyone,\nI am currently in my last semester as an undergrad, and graduating with a B.S in Political Science. I am also planning on getting into an MPA Program upon graduation. I am on ICMA to learn how realistic it is to get into city/county management and what steps should I take, so as to maximize my value to become a City/Council Manager. \nI have limited experience when it comes to city government, but I have served as a fraternity president, and am looking to get a Senate seat in graduate school.\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",
