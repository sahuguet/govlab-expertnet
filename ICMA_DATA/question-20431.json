You may want to limit your empirical comparisons to some demographically similar cities.  I would also recommend discussing what measures you choose to compare with someone at the Center and your faculty advisor.  I do not believe there is commonly accepted criteria on what constitutes a well-managed city, although as Tyler indicates above, others have tried.\n\n\nTyler,\nYou should be able to get some good information from ICMA's Performance Measurement Center, although the comparison you propose is not a simple matter.

Elected executives commonly subscribe to the popular notion that governments are \"top-heavy\" (whether they are or not), so they shave off administrative positions and as a result have a very difficult time responding to requests or collecting data or knowing much of anything about what's happening in their organization.\nAlso, look at whether they're a recipient of the GFOA Budget Presentation Award.  This award is the \"gold standard\" of budget documents and indicates the city is striving to create an informative, readable, and organized document so that both citizens AND staff have a strong guiding document for the town's resources and activities.  A good budget document is an essential tool for forward-thinking management, and I think you'll find that council/manager governments are more inclined to pursue that as a goal.\nAlso look at how well a town's pension and other post employment benefit liabilities are funded.  Every town with a pension plan is required to have an actuarial report in order to assess the anticipated long-term costs of the plans and how well the city is financially-poised to handle those costs.  Again, underfunding pension is a short-term political maneuver that might be more tempting to a short-term elected executive vs. a long-term career manager.\nI'd also look at staff turnover.  In my personal experience I've seen a number of strong mayor governments have quite a revolving door particularly in key management positions where you really need to have some stability and organizational memory in place.  Strong mayors have strong personalities and fallouts with department heads are beyond commonplace, so every time there's a new mayor you end up with some of your best and brightest on the outs with the chief exec, which often ends in resignation or termination.\nI'm sure there are some people who would vehemently disagree with me on many of these points, and it's not to say there aren't some great mayors out there who have very well-managed cities... but I do strongly feel that, by and large, there's something inherently advantageous in hiring a chief executive based on their merits, vs. having a chief executive elected by the public based on who the political powerhouses and special interest machines from each partisan committee choose to nominate as their candidate.\n\n\nOne good measure would be infrastructure quality measures... like road quality ratings (there is a universal measure for that) or average age of paved road surfaces, average years since schools have been substantially renovated, etc.  Professional managers are useful in keeping the capital budget alive, whereas elected officials can gain more from deferring urgent infrastructure needs and pushing it onto the next guy in order to keep taxes low.\n\nAlso keep note of how many cities/towns run by mayors actually get back to you or even have the information available.

      "text": "\n\nWow, what an undertaking!  You might have something there with bond ratings.  There's a big difference between high grade and highly suspect, and the condition of the city's finances and the reliability of long term forecasts are the responsibility of the manager or mayor.  If you focus your comparison on budgeting terms you might have access to everything you need in online budget documents.  I wouldn't use a per capita spending measure since it's subject to citizen preferences which differ dramitically from city to city.  You could make the argument that a healthy reserve is indicative of good management and go from there.\n\n\nWow, what an undertaking!  You might have something there with bond ratings.

  "text": "\n\nI am a student working on my undergraduate thesis, the topic of which is comparing the overall effectiveness of city managers to city mayors.  What I am looking for here are some concrete ways to compare municipalities, i.e. fiscal performance (bond ratings?), per capita spending, responsiveness to citizens, etc.  I hope to show that cities run by professional managers will be more efficient and effective, but first I need some specific things to compare!  I would greatly appreciate any advice.  Thank you.\n\n",
