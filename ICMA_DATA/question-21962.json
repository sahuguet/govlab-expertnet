FY13 budget includes only $8,000 for new contracted engineering services, plus debt service for old engineering project fees.

If so, how do you determine what is contracted out and what is done in-house? How does the City Engineer position interact with the Public Works Director (i.e., subordinate to, support, etc.)?\nPlease also include the City Engineer's job description with your response if it is available. \nMy thanks in advance.\n\n",
