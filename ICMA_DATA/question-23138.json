This sounds like an extremely interesting assignment and I hope when you are finished you submit it to the Knowledge Network so others can learn from you and your local government. In the meantime here is a document that gives examples of software that local governments find useful for analyzing large amounts of data. You may find these are helpful to you and provide a new perspective to the citizen survey data. \nhttp://icma.org/en/BlogPost/1885/How_Could_Cities_and_Counties_Use_Data_Analytics\nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Michael, \n\nUnfortunately at the moment we do not have any documents regarding the kinds of correlations you might find in your data.

  "text": "\n\nHello all.\nWe recently gave a citizen survey. We have analyzed the results and sent out an informational brochure to the public. We still have a lot of data, however. I have been tasked with coming up with some correlations within the data (i.e. neighborhood to feeling of safety). I have a lot of latitude with this assignment, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas regarding what correlations to make. Is there anything particularly useful that you have found?\nThanks!\n\n",
