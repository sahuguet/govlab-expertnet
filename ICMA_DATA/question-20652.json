Many communities value undeveloped park land for its open space qualities/benefits and wildlife habitat so I believe that there are some legitimate reasons for including undeveloped land within the calculation.  I guess it boils down to what are you attempting to measure and then developing a sound basis for the analysis.  It might mean that your analysis contains both calculations because developed and undeveloped park lands would, I assume, have different capital and operating costs as well as different user groups.
