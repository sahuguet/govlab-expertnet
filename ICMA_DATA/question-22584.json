On the other hand, a larger city will probably want someone that has experience managing a department with a sizable budget. Generally speaking, the most marketable candidates have completed an internship that exposed them to multiple government departments, while also spending a few years gaining experience in one core area, such as finance, planning, or engineering. Joining ICMA and becoming involved in another professional association also serves to demonstrate your commitment to city management. \nBy the way, I'm a native of Pinellas County and interned there awhile back. They used to have a great internship program (more like a fellowship, as it was a salaried position), but cut it when the recession hit. You may want to check with the County Manager and see if it's something they've considered bringing back.\nBest of luck! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any other questions.\n\n\nWelcome, Erin. The answer is that it all depends.

The council appreciated the deeper knowledge of the town and strong motivation that came from growing up there. But there was no substitute for years of experience, and they selected an older professional with a proven record in grants and marketing. I took a regular position in a mid-sized city with opportunities for development: quite contented.\nLast month another nearby town selected a 26-year old manager (story below). The council noted his work ethic, education, and vision. The town is in a stable place after years of good management, so the new manager will have veteran support and be able to bring new ideas. It may just be a matter of persistence and finding the best fit with council and staff.\nGood luck!\nhttp://www.nvdaily.com/news/2013/05/woodstock_welcomes_new_town_manager_lauds_bradford-mobile.html\n\n\nAt 23 I had just finished the MPA and returned to a good internship in my home city.

There are numerous articles that touch on the skillset required of tomorrow's managers. \nI would definitely echo the advice that you consider what kind of community (location, size, diversity of projects/community, etc.) you want to work in, and then figure out the kind of positions that will take you where you want to be. \nAlso, consider the management Fellowships and internships that Jared mentioned. They are a great way to get to see multiple facets of a local government (the manager's view) and depending on the Fellowship, get near carte blanche for carving out learning opportunities. Great question!\n\n\nGreat advice from the other postings. You might also review this collection of nextgen related articles from PM Magazine:  http://bit.ly/13UqpQ5 .
