Bottom line is the fact that unless there are compelling circumstances and strong executive leadership getting a new initiative off the ground is all but impossible.  \nBefore getting into the core question I would like to point out that we already have many examples of shared services in and around our respective organizations.  Within a city for example centralized human resources and legal departments are services that are shared across the enterprise.  In other cities these functions may be entirely decentralized.  Information technology seems to be the latest ping pong ball bouncing back and forth between centralized and decentralized service models.\nOn a different level are regional shared services such as public safety dispatch or animal control.  In a certain sense special purpose districts might be considered shared services since their existence is predicated on providing specialized service(s) on a large enough scale to make it economically feasible.\nAvoiding mistakes in shared services\nWhether an internal or external shared service successful models of which I am aware embody the same basic principles.  These include:\n\u2022   Shared vision and purpose\n\u2022   Cost sharing is equitable;\n\u2022   Risk is shared;\n\u2022   Mission is not diluted;\n\u2022   Roles & responsibilities are clearly defined;\n\u2022   Benefits are clear\nThe glue that holds it all together is some form of formal governance, funding and decision making structure.  Internal shared services already have the structure in place; external, multi-agency services have a steeper road in setting up the governance, funding and management structure.  All of this implies a good deal of executive leadership and a certain amount of time dedicated to the stewardship of the program.   Extra time and effort is required to get new programs off the ground. \nIndividual program circumstances will dictate the level of dedicated staffing resources needed to start and sustain a new program.  Consolidating service internally may not require any special dedicated support.  Sustaining external efforts will almost always need dedicated resources if for no other reason than to serve as a neutral facilitator.  Voluntary, staff level collaboration will only last until the first disagreement or crisis.\nExternal shared services have to contend with several additional issues such as changes in leadership, cost sharing, ownership of property, debt and changes in membership.  Any one of these issues could have profound effect on the success of the program.\nLastly, if you build it, will they join?  What some may consider to be the best solution will likely be the antithesis to others.  So the caution is not to construct a program on the assumption that future, but uncommitted new members will join to ensure sustainability.  Depending on the nature of the program adding new member organizations after the fact can create a fair amount of stress for both the shared service program and the new member agency.  This will be particularly true of line staff from the new city have not fully embraced the shared service model.  \nI have been the director of the eCityGov Alliance since it was formed as an interlocal agency in 2002 by nine city managers and city administrators.  The Alliance provides seven online shared service web portals to over 45 government agencies in the Puget Sound region of Washington State.  The Alliance has received numerous recognitions including the ICMA Interlocal Collaboration Award in 2005 and twice been a finalist for the Harvard Innovations in American Government Award (2006, 2007).
