The higher rate is for employees who by the nature of their job are expected to receive a higher volume of city related business calls (i.e. inspectors, right of way negotiators, etc.)  We consider it an allowance and it is paid through payroll and subject to all applicable taxes.  This is intended to compensate for voice servicesonly, not data services.

  "text": "\n\nGreetings!\nLike most organizations, the City of Mesa, Arizona is evaluting stipends for employee-owned cell phones and SMART phones used for City business - in lieu of City-owned devices.  If you compensate your employees for the use of their wireless devices, please reply with the amounts and how the amount is determined (e.g., voice only, voice/data, etc).  If you offer a device purchase allowance, please provide that amount also.\nThank you!\nPaul Czohara\nIT Administration\nCity of Mesa, Arizona\n\n",
