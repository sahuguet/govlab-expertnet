There are a lot of issues that can be address by providing this service in the nursing homes. I am particularly looking at starting a renal specific nursing home due to issues that arises from nursing homes taking care of renal patients. I would love to talk with you more about this issue and to find out what information you might have discovered. The reasons I have for a specific nursing home providing for renal patients only stems from several reasons one is the article provided by the Department of Nephrology at Duke University Medical Center (rasheeda.stephens@duke.edu.) stating that the increase of patients needing renal care will be increasing with the baby boomers coming of age. Also working at a dialysis clinic there are many issues surrounding these patients being transported to outpatient clinics for treatments. I have multiple of others including diet and fluid restrictions, hygiene care for patient while out of nursing home, weakness of patients that is why they are in nursing homes, the quick treatment provided in outpatient clinics, instead of the nice, slow easier treatment that could be provided for patient while in the nursing home, ( my preference is nocturnal dialysis due to the easier affect on weaken patients) and just the transportation problems such as hours of waiting to and from nursing home when patient's are not feeling well due to fast treatment, and just dialysis treatment is rough on patients especially if it is done in 4 hours or less in outpatient settings. I believe providing a nursing home specifically for renal patients can answer all of these concerns and eliminate some hospitalizations and morbidity of these renal patients that are in nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities.\n\n\nScott, I have been a dialysis nurse for over 8 years and I am presently working on a business plan to address this issue of providing dialysis to nursing home patients.

  "text": "\n\nFor those of you that own a skilled nursing facility (nursing home), does anyone offer in-patient renal dialysis as a Medicare reimbursed service.  The County of Peoria is constructing a new nursing home and is considering adding renal dialysis services for the residents.  This service is new to nursing homes in Illinois and thus there is not much operational data in Illinois.  If you have a nursing home that provides this service, I would be interested in talking with you, or having your nursing home administrator talk with our nursing home administrator about your operation.\n\n",
