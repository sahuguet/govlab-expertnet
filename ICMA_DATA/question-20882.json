      "text": "\n\nThe issue of overtime frequently becomes an issue in fire departments using the 24 hour schedule. The first thing to negotiate is the ability to flex staff. Most fire departments staff for peak workload -- which usually occurs between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in most cities we have studied. Outside of those times, workload falls off -- often drastically. Do you have the ability to staff for peak times and reduce staffing in off hours? \nA second issue to avoid is minimum staffing. Private ambulance services are able to generate profit because they deploy staff when it is required, how it is required, and where it is required using dynamic staffing models that were developed in the UK.  Using dynamic staffing, resources are moved according to data and demographic changes in a community, avoiding both fixed stations and fixed staffing. The end result is usually better performance in response time and the ability to cover costs.  What is usually lacking in most departments, however, is data.  \nStaffing can be accomplished through paid-on-call, volunteer, or, in at least one college city, done by utilizing students who are trained firefighters and receive tuition assistance in lieu of salary.  Particularly in off-peak, low demand times, this can be a significant savings.\n\n\nThe issue of overtime frequently becomes an issue in fire departments using the 24 hour schedule.

      "text": "\n\nHi,\nFirst of all, sorry for my \"poor\" english level. I'm European, living in Brasil. Expert in structural firefighting for more than 10 years, I instruct \"flashover instructor\" for fireservices.\nYulia question is interessting as it's about cost of fire and replies are about cost of firefighter. But we need FF only if there is fire. So we face two questions: 1) what is the cost of a man 2) what is the cost of a well trained man.\nUsing students is a bad idea as if they have to leave college for EMS of firefighting they will not learn. Or the fireservice call them in hollidays and in this case they are like \"common workers\".\nPaid-on-call is a good solution, but you may have a \"good motivation\". Eg in France, we loose about 10% of volunter each year and the instruction cost a lot. But when you stay in your village during week-end, for no fire and only 1 EMS, it's not very interesting. \nAlso, we know that younger are the volunter, faster they exit the fire service. So you instruct them, and one or two years after, bye bye!!\nBut I think the real question is the level of your firefighters. They perform a job and the question is \"do they perform it correctly?\"\nAnd when we look at US FF video on Youtube, the answer can't be positive. \nSo you can ask \"how many dollar do I have to pay to have a FF\". But you can also ask \"how many dollar do I have to pay to help people which house was in fire, who call the Fireservice and see the house burts in flame, with FF flowing water for 3 hours (cost of water, pollution, cost of trucks) and transforming a little house in swimming pool\"...\nBest regards\nPierre-Louis\n\n\nHi,\nFirst of all, sorry for my \"poor\" english level.
