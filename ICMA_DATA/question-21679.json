  "text": "\n\nHello, a Texas entity is looking for information from any individuals here that might have experience or research regarding the selling of receivables in the public sector. I've seen a little bit of research regarding how Florida and some Conn. municipalities handle delinquent property taxes, but I haven\u2019t seen much beyond that.\nI am particularly interested in learning if any Texas municipalities, counties, or state entities have engaged, or are currently engaged, in the practice of selling their accounts receivables - may they be delinquent or otherwise. Thank you for your assistance.\n\n",
