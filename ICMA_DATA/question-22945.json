They put up video cameras to catch the vandals in the act but the vandals ended up using spray paint to cover the camera lenses. Following this, they purchased lenses equipped with a treatment that caused the paint to immediately bead up and drip off, allowing the cameras to continue to function. This contributed to a decrease in vandalism at the parks.\n\n\nWhile my father was the Director of Public Works for the Town of Cedarburg, Wisconsin, he had to deal with this issue.

In some cases it\u2019s as simple as asking for assistance with increased patrols, or PD asking parks to trim trees and shrubs so that police have increased visibility into the site.  In other cases we have co-written grants to focus on community policing which have provided funds for installation of new lights, removal of attractive nuisances (ie. A picnic ramada at the back portion of a park with no visability and access), and increased programming of the park.  Many times we have restricted park access when incidents occur and posted signs that state the closure (this example is from a Skate Park location \u2013 \u201cVandalism in the restroom will result in skate park closure.\u201d  The intent on the closure will be to keep the gates locked for three days if there is excessive vandalism in the restroom.  Again, this is an area where our Parl Rangers will work with PD to enforce the skate park closure.\n\n\nHere is a response from our Parks, Recreation, and Commercial Facilities Director, Marc Heirshberg, CPRE: We have really built a strong relationship between our Park Rangers and our Police Department to work cooperatively in areas where there is increased criminal activity.

The park we are having trouble with is approximately 82 acres and is located in an industrial/rural area of town, so the idea of a neighborhood watch probably isn't feasible.

  "text": "\n\nI'm interested in hearing ideas for how to combat vandalism in city parks. Specifically, we have had issues with groups vandalizing our park bathrooms after dark. The obvious solution would be to close the parks at dusk; however, the community has voiced a desire to keep them open until at least 9 p.m. We have discussed cameras and increasing patrols. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n",
