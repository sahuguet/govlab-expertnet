Once you start contributing to non-profits outside the scope of normal government services, it is difficult to tell other agencies \"no.\" Plus we have found that many citizens resent their tax dollars going to third party programs and have cut back on direct contributions to the United Way. The only exception is that we do contribute to recreation program providers who carry out youth athletic programs at City facilities because we do not have the in-house staff in the Parks Department to do so. Since we would have to provide the program in-house without this arrangement, it is a \"win-win\" for the City and service providers such as the YMCA, etc.\n\n\nAt the City of Brentwood, the elected body decided that the CIty would not contribute to non-profits (in general) because of the worthy nature of most programs and the inability of the City to decide which programs are good and worthy of the limited, available government funding and which are not.

This grant program provides a competitive process to receive this money that are budgeted from the general fund.   The limited amount and the use of the parks/rec. board have been successful ways to reduce the pressure on the council to be 'sympathetic' to the many issues in the community.  The parks/rec. board has become proficient at reviewing grant applicants and weighing the value of projects in relation to the available funding.  The grant program has been well received.   Applications for the two grant programs can be accessed on the city's website:\nwww.ci.wilsonville.or.us\n\n\nDue to the volume of requests from special interest groups coming directly to council and budget commitee, the City Council of Wilsonville, Oregon established (2009) a grant fund that is administered through the Community Services Department and reviewed and awarded by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board to handle requests from local nonprofits and special interests.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County have entered a comprehensive review of how funding to community agencies is determined so that the localities can establish a process for determining priorities for local government funding during difficult times. We have asked the Charlottesville/Albemarle Commission on Children and Families (CCF) to lead a research and planning study to develop recommendations for a prioritization process for local government funding. In consultation with our offices. One of the primary research strategies is to study how other communities establish priorities. If your locality has conducted a similar study or has an established method for determining priorities, I would appreciate any information you can provide. Please contact CCF Director Gretchen Ellis, whose contact information is below. Thank you for your assistance.\nGretchen Ellis, Director   \nCharlottesville/Albemarle Commission on Children and Families\n1600 Fifth St. Charlottesville, Va. 22902\n434-872-4548 (phone) \u00b7 434-872-4573 (fax)\ngellis@albemarle.org\nwww.ccfinfo.org\n\n",
