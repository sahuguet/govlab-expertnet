  "text": "\n\nBrunswick, Georgia (pop. 16,000) is a coastal community with a struggling waterfront. We recently received a federal Dept. of Commerce grant to develop a masterplan for our primary waterfront park. It has docks, a gazabo overlooking the river, a vegetable market, and other facilities. Our masterplan will include upgrading park facilities and making the park more accessible to and from downtown Brunswick.\nQuestion: My first Masterplan Stakeholders meeting will be held soon. Twenty merchants and park user group reps will be there. Many of them have endorsed the Masterplan project; however, many of the Stakeholders do not know one another very well.  HOW DO I APPROACH THIS FIRST STAKEHOLDERS MEETING? Should I discuss the project goal? Should I have \"mini-pre-meetings\" with major stakeholders prior to the first meeting? Should we discuss subcommittes at the very first meeting? I need to make this first meeting to be productive while also being collaborative. It will set the tone for the rest of the project.\nThank you.\nRichard \"Dick\" Newbern\nBrunswick, Georgia\n\n",
