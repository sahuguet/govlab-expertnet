Reach out to the Assistant to the City Manager there and she'll have a complete feedback form and everything that you can use. I don't know if they're still using it though - we found that the electeds rarely filled them out after meetings.

We are looking for a quick survey to give each member of the Council so that they can give staff feedback on how the issue was handled by staff; whether or not they have suggestions for improvement; how information was distributed, etc.  This particular issue was a zoning issue, but it doesn\u2019t have to be specific to zoning.  Thanks.\n\n",
