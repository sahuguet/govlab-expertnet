  "text": "\n\nThe Charlotte Mecklenburg Utility Department is researching successful environmental education throughout the United States; specifically on Water Education targeted to k-12 students. \nHas your city developed a new or innovative environmental education program that you would be willing to share information or email materials? If not, do you know of any communities that have new, innovative, or successful environmental education programs?\nI would appreciate any information that you would have to share. The Utilty currently has contacts in the school system but is looking to develop a long term water education program to increase contact with the students of our community and to foster environmental stewardship with our natural resources. \nThank you very much for your assistance and please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns\nChristine Edwards\nCommunity Outreach Specialist \nCharlotte Mecklenburg Utility Department \n4222 Westmont Drive\nCharlotte NC 28207\nO:704-336-3588\nC: 704-502-7292\n\n",
