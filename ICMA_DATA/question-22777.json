Additionally you can probably contact that local government's HR department directly for more detailed instructions. I hope this helps! \nBest, \nRobin Saywitz\nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Kasmira,\n\nI am unfortunately unfamiliar with the City of Prescott, AZ's specific hiring policies but you can always check the jobs section of our website (http://icma.org/en/icma/career_network/job_seekers/browse_jobs) and see if they have any entry level jobs available.
