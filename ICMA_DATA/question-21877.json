      "text": "\n\nDepending what State you are in, it could be at will employment of Termination without cause.  Stating a cause can expose the city to liability it would not otherwise we have.  I have had this conversation with the city attorney many times here in California where it is a liability problem.  I generally feel a person has a need to know why they are terminated and what will be said when a background check occurs.  Perhaps they would be willing to discuss it if you provide the city and them a full liability release for any claims of wrongful termination.\nHaving said that, it seems if you look inside yourself you should have seen some signals of dissatisfaction somewhere along the lines and should be able to deduce what the cause might have been at that time.  It is just so unusual and difficult for a manager to hide their dissatisfaction completely.\n\n\nDepending what State you are in, it could be at will employment of Termination without cause.

I would offer a Release of Liability in hopes that this would free the agency\" of any concerns of liability issues.  I would also ask the former CAO to level with you - as one professional to another -for your growth both professionally and personally. As ICMA Members, we have an obligation to support each other professionally.  If the CAO was taking direction from the Board - I hope he also believed your termination was appropriate.  Part of the job of a CM (not necessarilly CAO) is to evaluate and take responsibility for personnel decisions - not to allow political interference in the administrative side of the organization..

One limiting or helping factor would be the definition of \"cause\" in the contract. \"Reason\" and \"cause\" represent 2 levels of feedback for the professional. Reason can be verbal but verifiable at the CAO level in some later employment vetting. The agency will never use the word CAUSE if there is a contractual \"for cause\" revocation of termination benefits. James and Rodrick (above) said it well.

  "text": "\n\nI am on my second MIT stint currently.  The first was a traditional without cause firing in that there was a new council majority and they wanted their own person and so my contract was not renewed.  However, the second one is causing me issues when I interview because I was a Deputy County Administrator and fired by the Administrator after he was called into an executive session by Council and told to do it.  I never had any warning, only good evaluations, never a word that there was an issue with me or my performance.  And so when asked what happened, all I have been saying is I don't know but I can speculate on any number of issues I was working on that could have made someone unhappy.  My last interview one of the Board members was very specific as to feeling that I had to know why I was fired and if not, it made me a poor manager.  Any thoughts on how to address this without going into a lengthy dissertation that there truly can be a \"without cause\" termination?  Thanks.\n\n",
