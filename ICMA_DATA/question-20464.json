  "text": "\n\nOur firm, The Tioga Group, is engaged in a freight infrastructure financing project for the National Cooperative Freight Research Program. One of the proposed mechanisms we are analyzing is a Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) fee. In the commercial trucking world, fuel purchase cards have options for drivers to enter odometer readings, thereby tracking VMT as part of their fuel purchases. \nIf such a fee were applied to public agencies such as city governments, the question of fuel purchasing practice arises. Is there any usable information out there about how common bulk fuel purchases are versus fuel card usage by local governemtns?  My guess is that only larger cities with substantial vehicle fleets would find it worthwhile to buy fuel in bulk, but I would appreciate any more definitive responses.\nDan Smith\nPrincipal, The Tioga Group, Inc.\nwww.tiogagroup.com\n\n",
