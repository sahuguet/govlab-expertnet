  "text": "\n\nICMA Members Career Resources \u2013\nMy name is Silas Clarke and I recently graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha with an MPA, specialization in local government.  I\u2019m currently seeking an Assistant City Manager or Assistant to the City Manager position and am trying to get my name out there.  \nI worked for the City of Omaha for over four years as the Assistant Grant Administrator/Budget Analysis.  My appointment ended after the Mayor decided not to run for reelection in 2009.  I also worked as a temporary coordinator in the small city of Onawa, Iowa for three month this year creating their first Capital Improvement Plan. Since I left my position at the City of Omaha, I have been a Project Coordinator for the University of Nebraska at Omaha and am trying to get back into local government.\nI welcome any advice you may have and would greatly appreciate hearing about job opportunities that are not advertised national.  I can be reached through the ICMA website or at silas.clarke@gmail.com.\nThank you,\nSilas Clarke\n\n",
