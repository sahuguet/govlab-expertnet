      "text": "\n\nToni, in Iowa non-profits are tax exempt from paying property taxes so even though they receive public services (such as police and fire) they don't support them.  In Iowa the burden is really placed on commercial property taxpayers who pay double what residential properties pay.  As for fees one thing we have researched is implementing a electric and gas utility franchise fee to more equitably generate revenue to pay for public safety services.  We are in the process of discussing this with our city council and may include it in our next budget instead of increasing property taxes to pay for new public safety positions.\n\n\nToni, in Iowa non-profits are tax exempt from paying property taxes so even though they receive public services (such as police and fire) they don't support them.
