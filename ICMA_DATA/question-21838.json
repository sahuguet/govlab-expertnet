  "text": "\n\nChesterfield County, like many counties in the east, experienced an earthquake on August 21, 2011. While we looked at all of our buildings right after the quake, it is only now that we are discovering \u201chidden damage.\u201d In one case we actually engaged a structural engineer to review one of our more critical facilities. While this event represents only one serious disaster that could have potential serious consequences, we are interested in what other organizations have done to organize internally to inspect and review their facilities for damage from natural disasters. Do you have any SOPs or other internal procedures that have proven effective in revealing the extent of damage or how you conduct your inspections?  Contact Bob Rivers 804-796-7098 or riversb@chesterfield.gov.\n\n",
