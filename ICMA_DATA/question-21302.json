The Manager/Supervisor has the authority to review the incumbent on the criteria and initiate the action to flexibly staff (move to the next level) the incumbent.  Each series of jobs that use flex staffing have CLEAR criteria to move the employee from one level to the next.  Flexibly staffed series tend to have higher turnover and larger number of incumbents, examples included:  Social Caseworker I to II, Patrol Deputy I to II, Vehicle Licensing Technician I to II, Planner I to II,  and Department Specialist I to II.  This process requires an audit process (position documentation collection and review) every few years to assure it's being used effectively.\nPros:\nProvides clear expectations to newly hired incumbent to attain the next level.  Increases communication of expectations between the incumbent and the supervisor manager.  Reduces the impact of classification management in Human Resources.  Reduces the number of job postings/requisitions.\nCons:\nManagers may interpret the requirements for the flex staffing differently if not written clearly and cause inconsistencies across the organization.  Not all work areas require a 'level II', so assuring appropriate use of the flex staffing where the progression can be controlled, i.e. the position doesn't HAVE to flex staff, it only flex staffs if criteria is achieved.  Additional communication on the differences between flexibly staffed series and regular promotional or classified series.\nBridget Paris\nCompensation Specialist\nLarimer County\nparisbl@larimer.org\n\n\nWe use flexible staffed positions in progressive job series.

  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance member is interesting in receiving information re: pros & cons of using a \"flexibly staffed job/class series\" for recruitment/promotion, as opposed to single classes (such as recruiting for a flexible class of Planner I, II, III versus recruiting separately just for a Planner II only, etc.).  \nI\u2019ve attached a document from Alaska re: Flexibly Staffed, Coupled, and, Multiple Class Positions. We\u2019re looking for other examples.\nThank you!   \nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450 Voice\n480-231-3538 Text\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
