First of all, there are actually many ways in which local governments already run business enterprises, even if they do not immediately seem to be such.  City/county airports, local recycling plants, and publicly-owned utilities are technically implementations of enterprise, albeit ones that are framed as being in the public interest.  As a matter of fact, many local governments, specifically municipalities, are actually chartered as corporations, in that the citizens are treated as though they are voting, \u201cshare-holding\u201d members of the local government.  \nSecondly, it is important to note that while local governments are able to construct, run, and own enterprises unless specifically prohibited by local charter or state regulations, they often refrain from doing so, and for good reason.  There are any number of historical instances where a publicly-maintained enterprise, such as a park system with a body of water that needs to be cleaned up for safe human use, where the issue of managing the business becomes a political football that is passed around to meet political ends, thus making the successful management of a business very difficult.  In sum, then while local governments are often authorized de jure to own/operate enterprises, de facto this is implemented in very few cases.\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Martin:\n\nHaving looked into your question, I would respond in two ways.
