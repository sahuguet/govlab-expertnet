Although managers are placed to coordinate day to day tasks of an organization, I believe leaders need to take on some of the more difficult day to day issues or special projects that may arise.  In my position, I have a great staff who handles 90% of our daily activities. That said, in addition to building a vision for the community, there are a handful of day to day activities I take on to show my staff that I am not above \"getting in the trenches\" with them.  This also helps me to \"scan\" our programs and policies to ensure things are being coordinate effectively and my overall knowledge of the daily routines is strengthened! Good question...\n\n\nHi Jessica - I agree with Mr. Hedquist, but I would like to add one other item.

Leadership is a rare quality... it not only requires a clear vision, but also the ability to inspire others into helping you make it happen.  It requires a thorough understanding of where an organization currently stands, what its issues are, where it needs to be, and what obstacles stand in the way of getting from point a to point z.  Sometimes towns and government agencies can survive without a strong leader; sometimes a strong leader can break an organization because they chart out a bold new path that ends up being more trouble than it's worth.  Managing involves keeping the status quo pressing on, whereas leadership involves defining and managing change, and a manager who wants to make changes for the sake of being a good leader may not be a good fit for some organizations.  There needs to be a real need for change, and the good leader knows how to proceed cautiously enough that he or she doesn't send their org careening off a cliff.  And the great leader must also be a great manager, because the basic functions cannot be overlooked or neglected for the sake of trying to do something new or take on challenges, and they must also be aware of what challenges their group has the ability, talent, and capacity to accomplish.  So I would discourage folks from considering managers as a mediocre category that lies a cut below that of the leader... vision and ambition involve some element of risk, and no risk is worth taking just for the sake of being bold.\n\n\nManaging is an essential job function... if you're a manager and you don't manage, you'll be out of a job quickly.
