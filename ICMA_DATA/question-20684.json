  "text": "\n\nWe are planning on rolling out organics collection (yard trimmings, fruits and vegetables) for 30,000 residents by the end of the fiscal year.  However, both major local composters can handle many other materials like meat, bones, dairy, soiled paper, bio plastics etc.\nMy question is, for those of you with organics collection programs, what materials do you accept/not accept and why (e.g. contamination, lack of a processor, lack of citizen approval)?  (If you are able to reply, please let me know how many residential customers you have.)\nThank you in advance for you input!\n\n",
