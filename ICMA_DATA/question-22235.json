  "text": "\n\nThe City of Rockville, MD is researching the option of adding inactive or Finaled utility bills to the monthly water disconnection list for non-payment in addition to the already existing water disconnection for active utility accounts for non-payment. I would appreciate some feedback as to whether or not your government entity disconnects water for unpaid utility bills for both inactive and active accounts or just active accounts, your rationale behind this decision, and, if you do cutoff inactive utility bills, then what are your procedures.\nThank you very much.\nJason Zimmerman\nRevenue Supervisor\nCity of Rockville\n\n",
