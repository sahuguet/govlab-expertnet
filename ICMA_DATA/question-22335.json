      "text": "\n\nWe have been relining our clay/concrete pipe with a \"cure in place pipe\" or CIPP.  It has been a successful way to replace pipe without having to did a new one in.  Early in my career, I favored the excavation route.  Since I have seen it installed here I have changed my mind.  The chief problem is making sure the right sewer taps are cut!  Coming back weeks/months later to cut a tap is difficult for the vendor.  One advantage of this type of pipe is that it can push broken pieces back into place as it is installed and cured.  What I saw was the liner was heated up with steam and air pressure to \"unfold\" the liner.  With the air pressure and steam, sometimes the VCP pipe will return to its shape--but not always.\nWhen we did this, we ran a camera down the line and decided whether the pipe needed a point repair or could be fixed with the pressure from the liner.  If we fixed the pipe we still ran the liner through that location.\n\n\nWe have been relining our clay/concrete pipe with a \"cure in place pipe\" or CIPP.
