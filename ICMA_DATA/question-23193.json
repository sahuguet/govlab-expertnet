We are trying to develop a more comprehensive engagement strategy during the budget process, and would like to learn what other communities are doing. \nAll of the data from the survey will be aggregated so your responses will not be identifiable. If you decide to participate, we will send you the finalized report. The survey should take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.\nPlease follow the link at the bottom of the email to complete the survey. Only one response per community is requested.\nIf you have any questions about the report or have any information you would like to share about your community engagement practices, please email (eblayney@charlottenc.gov) or call me (704-432-3218). \nAdditionally, if you would prefer to respond to the survey over the phone, I am happy to schedule a call.\nThank you for your support.\nSurvey Link:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uyiwWriuWNbzsO3XQp-ConDxoOM0BXK2fYzAA26vl8Y/viewform?usp=send_form\n\n",
