  "text": "\n\nI know that some progressive counties have expanded the information it collects from departments in order to better integrate performance and budgeting.  From what I understand, usually, the first step in this process is to develop a comprehensive inventory of services that will be used to fully understand everything a city/county does, how many resources each service requires, how the service is carried out, etc.\nDoes anyone know some progressive counties that have created service inventories?  What have other jurisdictions done and found successful in introducing and managing this process?  I know the City of San Jose has created one http://www.sanjoseca.gov/budget/FY1011/12ProgramDictionary/07ManagerOffice.pdf , are there any other examples?\n\n",
