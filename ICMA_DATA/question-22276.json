They offer a model that utilizes peer review for comparing proposed expenditures against community goals.  It appears to be a good way to build more of a stewardship role among staff in creating budget recommendations and help to \"flesh out\"  expenditures and assign \"tier levels\" to those expenditures in an objective way against community goals.  \nAlso, as we learned in HPO training, creating that \"shared vision\" among our staff persons is a great way to create more ownership/stewardship in our organizations.  That seems to be a good starting point for discussions such as this as it may help to avoid those inevitable \"turf\" battles.  \nI would also think that getting to a level of common understanding about the services provided by each department would be a good thing to do early on.  My experience is that not all managers consistently understand the either the service or perceived community value of each others' departmental activities.  For example, does everyone see the value of the recreation activities and the importance of those activities to the quality of life in the community?  Often those are the areas we \"target\" first when in reality there may be some of the more basic services that often seen as \"untouchable\" when in reality, not everything that those departments do (police, fire, etc.) are directly supportive to community goals.    If we can \"share\" the budget decisions with common vision, we can hope to have more of a \"shared approach\" to decision making.  \nI think your back ground in HPO could help to guide you through this portion of your discussion and the modeling offered by the Priority Based Budgeting model may add \"metrics\" to this discussion.\n\n\nHi Leslie!

      "text": "\n\nLeslie, always a good idea to explore new approaches especially in the super current intense environment surrounding departmental and overall budgets.  Twice in my career I have been in lead roles as you describe.  At the outset, your approach can make sense and be productive providing that there is already buy-in from the departments' leadership in how the functional areas are defined.  Without such pre-budget deliberation buy-in, department heads can approach such discussions from a threatened view point that being part of a functional area is not complementary but rather a challenge to department components.  The other direct challenge for you will be to set the tone and focus for such sessions to avoid a potential of confrontation among departments in a functional area by making it clear that it is a level playing field and that at the outset there is no pre-set agenda that certain cuts and savings will have to be made.  I hope this is helpful.\n\n\nLeslie, always a good idea to explore new approaches especially in the super current intense environment surrounding departmental and overall budgets.

      "text": "\n\nHi Leslie.  I just noticed your post and it is 21 days old now, so I am not sure you will even see this response, but let me offer it anyway.  In terms of how to structure and facilitate line item budget reviews with departments, I don't think there is any special approach I can offer.  What I did want to suggest was more along the lines of how NOT to have the meetings.  There are several things to file away for consideration in future budget cycles.  \n1.)  Establish a strong link between business plans and budgets and let the business plans be the discussion about what needs to change.  Make sure the business plans include financial projections.  Have the conversations and make the decisions early in the year, long before the budget process, in fact make business planning drive budgeting.  \n2.)  Implement multi-year budgeting.  More and more municipalities are pursuing this and the payback - if done right!- can be significant.  \n3.) Absolutely consider Cheryl's advice about Priority or Performance Based Budgeting.   It changes the conversation from line items to purpose and performance.\n4.)  Make sure to invest in a strong performance measurement program.  This will provide linkages between strategies, business plans, budget and performance that are necessary to change that conversation about line items.\n5)  Invest in a cycle of department reviews - call them zero based or 4E or whatever, but use these reviews to drill down to the basics of services, service levels and the cost of services.   This is kind of like zero based reviews in that they force departments to review what they do, why and what it costs, but just not a part of the annual budget cycle.    The results of the reviews make for a MUCH more informed budget cycle for the department that is being reviewed.\nHope this helps.\n\n\nHi Leslie.

  "text": "\n\nWe are looking to really change the way we do budget deliberations and decision making with department heads in preparing the Manager's Proposed Budget.  We have in the past sat down with each department individually to talk about their line items.  For this process, I am proposing to sit down with department heads and their budget preparation staff in functional areas \u2013 public safety, infrastructure, operations, etc.  They would present their budgets to each other, discuss new requests and reductions and as a group come up with some proposals for the City Manager.  \nI am looking for some advice and guidance on how to facilitate these meetings, best way to structure them, etc.   Any and all ideas would be appreciated.  \nThanks!\n\n",
