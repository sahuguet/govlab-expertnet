It does not directly address your query but does include as an appendix an outsourcing contract from Alexandria, Virginia, so perhaps that\u2019s a jurisdiction you could contact.\nAdditionally, we do know that Arlington County, Virginia, has contracted out all animal control for well over 20 years.  The contract is with the Animal Welfare League [  http://www.awla.org/ ] and is managed by Arlington\u2019s Public Health Division of the Department of Human Services.\n\n\nIn 2001, ICMA published with the Human Society of the United States a book entitled Animal Control Management (http://bookstore.icma.org/Animal_Control_Management_A_G_P609C16.cfm item 43008 in the ICMA online bookstore).

      "text": "\n\nThe City of Billings, MT, outsourced its shelter operations two years ago to a local group through an RFP.  The city continues to provide the animal control operation because of the health-related issues of rabies control, strays, etc.  The city also retained ownership of its 6-year-old shelter.  Two kennel employees were laid off .  We pay the animal shelter organization slightly less than it cost the city to run the shelter itself, because a national review showed that a private shelter without  a municipal contract or an affiliation to a major group such as the ASPCA or Animal Welfare League usually cannot raise sufficient funds to sustain itself.  The funding gives the private group a base to raise additional dollars that are devoted to programming and shelter improvements.  The next test will come as we negotiate the second contract, and see the price.  Benefits are that the animal control staff, which initally opposed the move, now is relieved to be able to spend its time focusing on the public health issues, and that the city has stopped receiving numerous complaints it used to get over shelter operations, kill rates, etc.\n\n\nThe City of Billings, MT, outsourced its shelter operations two years ago to a local group through an RFP.

  "text": "\n\nI am researching Animal Control organizations that have experience in outsourcing some or all of their operations (field services, sheltering operations etc..). While any references may be helpful, I am most interested in larger sized organizations as they most closely resemble ours. Statistics, both operational and financial, would be greatly appreciated as would referrals or points of contact to organizations other than your own that you may know of that could provide insight to these matters as well. Thanks in advance for any assistance you may be able to provide.\nRegards,\nMichael Honer\nHillsborough County Animal Services\nTampa, FL\n\n",
