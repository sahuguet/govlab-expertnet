The questions you have to ask are, \"if we have the investment grade audit, do you have the staff capacitiy to implement the projects?\" The second question is \"how important is a performance guaranty?\" And finally, \"do you need financing, or are you going to self fund through capital?\" I go back and forth on this when people ask me. We funded our project with capital, we probably had the staff capacity, and we have a top notch purchasing department, as much as the guaranty and construction management was nice, I think there is a good chance we could have implemented a larger project for less money.\n\n\nMichael, the City of Farmington Hills, MI has also participated in a performance contract with an ESCO.

The employees of ESCOs  have families as well and work hard to gain your business; should they not be able to make a little profit on their creativity and experience, the same as any other supplier?  There is much more to a Performance Contract implementation than carving up the IGA into pieces that can be done internally.  Although some conservation measures are plug and play, such as lighting and perhaps simple water retrofits, most mechanical upgrades are not, which are what is usually needed by customers.  In my experience, one should be wary of PC vendors that use it as a stepstool to sell their brand of building controls or equipment, since they may have hefty ongoing maintenance service charges in the years to come.  Good luck!\n\n\nESCOs are lucky to break even on the Investment Grade Audit, especially RFPs that make the audit price a part of the selection process.

Also PC allows you to complete a bundle of projects with just one contract with an ESCO.  If you try to piecemeal multiple projects you will be required to go through the RFP/Bid/Contract process multiple times without any guaranty.  \nThere are no real pitfalls for the customer.  If the PC project does not meet the savings that are guaranteed the ESCO has to pay the customer for any shortfall.  Some ESCOs will offer a free energy audit to start the process.  You certainly can't beat \"free\".  PC has been done for decades all over the country I don't know why it won't work for you.  PC will make you a hero in the eyes of the stake holders. \nAdvice: Stay away from the large manufacturers.  Use one of the independent ESCOs.  The manufactures have higher costs which reduces the scope of work that can be accompished in the PC project.  \nGood Luck!\n\n\nYou stated that you don't think that PC projects will pay for themsleves in Alabama.
