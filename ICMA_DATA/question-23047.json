  "text": "\n\nHello everyone,\nI am posting to the Knowledge Network on behalf of a UW-O Graduate Student looking for information on time off policies. If you could please post your answers on the forum before April 5th, I would appreciate it. You may also send your reply to him directly, if you would prefer that. His email is below.\nThanks\nHello \u2013 My name is Robert Schipper. I am a graduate student at UW-Oshkosh in the Master\u2019s of Public Administration program enrolled in the Public Policy Analysis class. Municipalities can ask our professor, Dr. Karl Nollenberger, for an analysis of a policy that could be under evaluation. My group\u2019s analysis is of the Village of Winneconne\u2019s (pop. 2,500) time off policy. Winneconne would like us to compare to other similar municipalities as to what their time off policies are. Would you be able to share your time off policy with us by answering the following questions?\n\nWhat is the equalized value of your municipality?\nWhat is your current population?\nNumber of employees (full-time and part-time)?\nJob classifications of employees (i.e. \u2013 police, DPW, administration)?\nWhat kind of time off is allowed (vacation, sick, holiday, military, funeral)?\nTraditional time off policy (multiple banks) or paid time off (all under one bank)?\nWhat are the accrual rates?\nHow much can be accumulated?\nCan unused time be carried over to the next year?\nIs there any short term or long term disability offered, and if yes, please explain?\nHow much can be paid out upon employee separation?\nHas there been any changes in the past five years to the time off policy and what were they?\nIf there were any changes, how were they received by the employees?\nIs there any other information that you think should be included?\nWhat do you estimate is the value of your time-off policy per employee is in dollars?\nThank-you for your time in this analysis. If you have any questions regarding this, I can be reached at (schipr61@uwosh.edu). Please reply by April 5, 2014.\nRobert Schipper\n\n\n",
