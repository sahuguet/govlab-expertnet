  "text": "\n\nHi Everyone, \nI am working on a project for a small town (population 1354) related to their fleet inventory. They currently do not have a system in place that allows them to track what repairs and auto parts are performed/used on different vehicles preventing them from knowing the life-cycle costs of their fleet. \nWhat systems do other small communities have in place to track repairs and parts done/used on specific vehicles?\nThank you\n\n",
