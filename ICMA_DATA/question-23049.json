  "text": "\n\nI'm seeking information from communities across the country on displaying/flying U.S. flags along main streets or main corridors for holidays. What holidays do you fly them? Currently, Bullhead City displays flags proudly on Civil Rights Day, President's Day, Vietnam Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Patriots Day, Election Day and Veteran's Day. The high cost of flags and the amount of staff time devoted to the endeavor is causing some rethinking of the days to display or at least reducing the number of flags displayed overall. Any thoughts on this issue would be greatly appreciated. It would be great to see a policy on the subject if anyone has one. Thank you! Toby\n\n",
