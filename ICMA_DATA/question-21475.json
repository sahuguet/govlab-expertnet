  "text": "\n\nRecently our Planning Commission has elected to adopt form based zoning for our downtown area. I am interested in hearing from other communities that have adopted form based codes. In Jonesville, we are a community of around 2,300 people. I am particularly interested in hearing from Planners and Administrators in similarly sized communities. How did you go about development and implementation? Did you hire Planning Consultants for this process? What were the timelines for development and implementation? And finally, were you satisfied with the results after implementation? Any feedback on this subject would be beneficial. I am also available for phone and email communication as well. \nTim McLean\nAssistant to the Village Manager\nVillage of Jonesville\nServices@Jonesville.org\n(517) 849-2104\n\n",
