The credentialing advisory board looks for a specific example of something learned from each professional development activity (as opposed to agendas and registration forms or just a list of what was attended). You can find a sample annual report as well as many other helpful resources at http://icma.org/en/icma/members/credentialing/credentialing_resources . Also, the FAQs sheet on that same page provides a great explanation of why the credentialing advisory board asks program participants to tell what they learned.\nI hope this helps,\nAmanda Dodge\nInternational City/County Management Association\nKnowledge Network Intern\n202-962-3699\nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Lee,\n\nIf you are documenting for ICMA\u2019s Credentialing Program, you can track at http://icma.org/credentialing after you are credentialed.
