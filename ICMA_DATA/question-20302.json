  "text": "\n\nGood evening,\nHaving learned of ICMA through an article on the website of the Reason Foundation, I am writing to ask if anyone has knowledge or experience that would inform a recommendation on privatizing one or more of the ten ice arenas operated by Ramsey County (MN).\nI am an MBA student in Saint Paul engaged in a consulting project with the county Parks and Recreation Department, focused specifically on the county's ice arenas.  Faced with economic challenges including both a demographic shift away from traditional skating ethnicities and significant competition, the county should perhaps consider a privatization initiative.  I'm considering this as a possible recommendation and would be grateful for input as to the pros and cons.\nOur presentation to the county takes place on August 24, so the timing is unfortunately pretty urgent.\nThank you!\nPete Pantzer\nHamline University MBA Program\nwww.hamline.edu\n\n",
