  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone administer a CDBG Microenterprise Grant (or loan) Program with HUD funding?  I am interested to see samples of typical grant/loan agreements.  The monitoring checklists on HUD's website is often a good starting point for crafting activity agreements, but in the case of Microenterprise activities, the requirements look very limited (at least in comparison with other programs).  Perhaps that means that the requirements of the grant agreement would be less cumbersome than other activities, but I wanted to float the question to find out from someone's experience.  I would sincerely appreciate any feedback and/or agreement samples.\nThank you,\nAndrew Ellard\nDepartment of Federal & State Programs\nCity of Hattiesburg, Mississippi\n601.545.4558\nAELLARD@HattiesburgMS.com\n\n",
