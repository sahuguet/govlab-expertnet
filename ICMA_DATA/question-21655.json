  "text": "\n\nI work for the solid waste department in the city of Tyler texas. Currently we pick up twice a week. Currently we pick up north routes on monday and thursday, and south routes on tuesday and friday. Should a holiday fall on a monday we roll that pickup to tuesday and then roll tuesdays pickups to wednesday. We are considering changing that so there pickup would be canceled until there next scheduled day. I am looking for any data that would support our cause when we go to city council with this proposal. I appreciate any responses I may recieve. Thanks\n\n",
