  "text": "\n\nLooking for examples of RFPs for a comprehensive records management plan. Would like it to include everything from the \"boxes in the basement\" to email retention and digital archiving. Have you had someone develop a plan for you? What did it include? What vendors are out there that offer this type of records management planning? Any information regarding this topic would be very appreciated.\n\n",
