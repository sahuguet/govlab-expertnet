      "text": "\n\nRick:  70% is certainly a typical payroll portion of a general fund, if the G.F. is \"full service\".  If there are limited services like mostly Police or Fire, that percentage may be higher by 5-10% due to the full benefits and pension costs.  Enterprise or special revenue funds may vary widely as to the payroll costs of specific service organizaitons.  Major capital improvements, if budgeted in an operating fund, may depress the payroll percentage of total, of course.\n\n\nRick:  70% is certainly a typical payroll portion of a general fund, if the G.F. is \"full service\".

  "text": "\n\nI am looking for a \"gut level\" response to the portion of O&M budget spent on wages and benefits. We are running about 70% of O&M Budget city wide for admin services, police, public works, and parks & recreation. \nWithout drilling too deep into your line item budgets...What percentage does your City spend on personnel related expenses. Especially if you are about 10,000 people in the West.\nThank you,\nRick Manchester, CPRP, MPA\nCity of Cody WY\n\n",
