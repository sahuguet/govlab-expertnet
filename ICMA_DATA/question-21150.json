  "text": "\n\nThe City of Clearwater received a patent on a remote control traffic device. The device is marketable to law enforcement agencies and traffic operations centers for municipalities and government entities. The device would need to be mass produced and marketed to municipalities. The City does not have the means or ability to do such production and marketing. We would like to issue an RFP for production and marketing services, and would like to know if any other local governments have gone through a similar process and would be willing to share their experiences.\n\n",
