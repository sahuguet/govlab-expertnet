  "text": "\n\nWe recently had a tragic situation in our city which resulted in the arrest of a juvenile for the murder of another juvenile .  Some councilmembers are unhappy because of what they believe to be a lack of details from me regarding the case.   What is your rule-of-thumb for releasing information to elected officials?  I am not comfortable in releasing information that is not public information to anyone, including elected officials, because I do not want to compromise any investigations.  Any advice is appreciated.\n\n",
