      "text": "\n\nHi Mike,  \nIn Raleigh, our new employee orientation actually lasts three days, and typically, HR likes to choose at least two different locations to hold orientation so that new employees can visit a couple new buildings.  Almost every department gets to make at least a short presentation, which not only gives you a feel for the department's work (and the fact that they exist, in the case of lesser-known departments like Community Development), but also gives you a contact in each department should you have questions.  We also incorporate National Incident Management System training into our orientation, and even though it can be lengthy, knowing you're prepared in the event of an emergency does give you a sense of ownership within the city.  \nIndividual departments also do their own orientation academies, and the one I did for Parks and Recreation included travelling around Raleigh in a city trolley, visiting several parks, and even riding one of the park carousels.  We definitely try to balance out the wordy parts with the fun parts!    \nI've attached a copy of our most recent citywide orientation schedule.  Hope that helps!\n\n\nHi Mike,  \n\nIn Raleigh, our new employee orientation actually lasts three days, and typically, HR likes to choose at least two different locations to hold orientation so that new employees can visit a couple new buildings.

Jim Keene, the city manager, discussed it in the Change by Design interview with Bob O'Neill and Tim Brown (http://icma.org/leadingideas). \nI also find using the book, \"The Adventures of Johnny Bunko\" by Daniel Pink (who spoke at the ICMA conference in 2007) to be a good conversation starter about making a difference/leaving an imprint and creating a \"this isn't your parents' workplace\" mentality.\nPersonally, I think the employee integration starts before even hiring someone - identifying the profile/type of person who best fits the organization's culture (either now, or where you want your culture to go), and trying to match that profile as close as possible during the interviews. Not to say you want all one type of person, but that you've mapped out what you want your organization to look like and find people that are (for example), comfortable with change or ambiguity, or don't mind an open-door atmosphere.\n\n\nI know the City of Palo Alto was reinventing their process, and started a year or two ago.

  "text": "\n\nWe are looking to revamp our employee orientation, including dropping the word \"orientation.\" \nOutside of the boilerplate HR regulations, IT policy, benefits, etc., we want to branch out and explore ways of instilling new hires with our city\u2019s culture from Day 1. As the Boomers retire we want to take steps to recruit the best young talent to take their places, and the same old orientation will not cut it. We are looking at something like a corporate incoming seminar being the rough template we use. \nI was just wondering if anyone has done something similar or if anyone just has some suggestions? \nWe really have a white sheet of paper to build our Employee Academy.\n\n",
