They also have calculated that the flushing program, tank draining and filling, and fire fighting account for 2-3% of unaccounted for water. To keep the rest at a minimum, they repair pipes as soon as they can and take other measures. \nSedgwick County, KS has temperature sensors installed to measure fuel expansion and contraction, which provide inventory reports with the actual fuel volume. This way, they do not have to pay for more fuel than they receive. \nI hope that helps!\n\n\nPamela/John:\nAs far as water goes, there is a manual from the American Water Works Association that can help you with that: http://apps.awwa.org/EbusMain/Default.aspx?TabId=55&ProductId=6725\nThe industry standard for a good amount of losses is anywhere under 10%.\nVirginia Beach, VA has a metered system for their water--any water that is lost from pipe leaks, etc. is measured byunderground meters, and they sum up all of those meter measurements and compare them to the master meter, which measures the bulk flow to the distribution system.
