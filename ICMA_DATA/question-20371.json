I will attach our memo to our Council and the spreadsheet of responses.\n\n[We] surveyed several cities to find out whether jurisdictions are using a paperless agenda process and whether the paperless process resulted in lower costs and/or less staff time spent assembling paperless packets.\nWe found that a good number of jurisdictions (9 of 18) are issuing laptops, ipads, or sending agendas through email and saving to CDs.  A couple require council/board members to download from the jurisdiction's website.  Almost none of them continue to send hard copies of their agendas to staff. Of those jurisdictions that have not gone paperless, they leave it to the discretion of their councils/boards to decide whether they receive hard copies, download it themselves, or have them emailed.\nThe City distributes 55 copies of the Council agenda packet internally and 45 are left over for the public (100 total).  We distribute 62 copies of the RDA packet internally and 15 copies are left over for the public (77 total). \nWe noted that there is not a significant reduction in the amount of staff time used for uploading information to electronic devices or emailing.  However, there is and can be a significant reduction in staff time for sending copies of agendas and attachments to internal staff.  For example, [staff] spends about 1.5 work days per week coordinating and organizing the 19 sets of hard copy enclosures that the City distributes weekly.\nAdditionally, there is a great deal of cost reductions associated with no longer sending copies of agendas to City staff.  For example, in July 2010, the average number of pages for the agenda packets was 45.  The total costs we incurred for the month was $869.50 divided by 4 weeks equals $217.38 per week.  Over a 6 months month period, the total is about $5,200. The $5,200 total does not include the 5 hard copies of the agenda packet we make in-house for Council, the costs for the 19 sets of enclosures, or the RDA packets.\nThe 19 sets of enclosures are produced by each department who is responsible for the staff report(s).  At a cost of about $.0055 per page, we estimate that enclosures cost a minimum of $0.55/set, $10.45/week, or $271.70 over 6 months.  On the high end, photocopying enclosures can cost upwards of $2.75/set, or $52.25/week.  The number of pages for the enclosures vary, but can range from 100 to over 500 per week.\nWhile some jurisdictions indicated that iPads paid for themselves within a year, we estimate the City would easily recoup the cost of purchasing five (5) iPads for Council use within 6 months.\nIt is undetermined how much ITS time would be required to maintain ipads, laptops, and similar technologies.\n#\n\n\nI just did a survey on this and got back responses from 18 jurisdictions.

Before Council authorized going ahead with it, our IT director presented a video he shot in his office (nice view of his trash can) to show how it would work.  That's posted on youtube.
