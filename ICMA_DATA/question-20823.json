Several positions were also identified for force reduction, but the hope is that many of those tabbed for a RIF can be matched to jobs vacated by retirement, thus avoiding a significant amount of layoffs.  This process is currently playing out, but the retirement program seems popular, and salary savings due to this are projected in the $1 million range.\n\n\nOur City instituted a Temporary Retirement Incentive Program (TRIP) to encourage longer term workers (who may be at the top of the payscale) who are close to retirement to leave early.

However, the only way it saves is if you \"SHUT DOWN\" one weekday.  Having flexible 10 hour work schedules and still open for business five days a week does not save any significant amount.  \nThe savings are realized if the offices are closed one additional day.  There will be savings in energy consumption at facilities and you should reduce absenteeism.  Employees should be able to schedule doctor\u2019s visits and similar personal items on their days off.  Since the workday will be lengthened, janitorial work at the offices may overlap slightly with work hours, that will be an inconvenience to some; but you need to shut down facilities at the normal time you do now.\nI assume that you have done or analyzed many of the other items noted like shutting down computers, eliminating training, travel, hiring freezes, etc\u2026.\nI will be on the lookout for more good ideas from the folks who respond.  This will be another challenging year.  Good luck to us all.\n\n\nAfter three years of General Fund reductions (Rollback plus legislation, Doubling of Homestead Exception, Property Value Decline) the fat has been taken out; we will need to reduce service.\nThe items noted in the Alliance document above are all realistic options in the current climate; negotiations with labor will be difficult as attempts are made to curtail salary and benefits.  \nOne thing that should be seriously considered is going to four 10 hour days.
