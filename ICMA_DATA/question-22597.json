Best practice will probably consists to measure Odor emission through Odor Flux Chamber (as given by USEPA), in order to measure odor emission flow (in odor unit per square inch of area and per second). From that result, depending distances with potential complainants, we could then determine percentage of remediation needed. In most cases, some real neutralizing agent can be used in order to decrease emissions, so also relative odor complaints.  \nIf you need any additional information, feel free to contact us at Info@OlfactoExpert.com   \nWe will also be present at the ICMA tradeshow in Boston this 22nd Sept.  \nBest regards,  \nYann H.
