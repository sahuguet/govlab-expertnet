I was able to find some documents that discuss the implementation of renewable energies and what to think about in terms of behavior change and financially to help make renewable energies a reality. While these studies are based in the US I think the basic principles should be transferable. \n-Property Assessed Clean Energy Bonds https://icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/301610\n-Asset Based Economic Development: Renewable Energy and Local Resources http://icma.org/en/international/resources/insights/Article/103998/AssetBased_Economic_Development_Renewable_Energy_and_Local_Resources\nBest, \nRobin Saywitz \nICMA Knowledge Network Intern \nrsaywitz@icma.org\n\n\nHi Nematullah, \n\nThank you for asking such an interesting question!

  "text": "\n\nAccording to Energy Directorate of Ministry of Energy & Water, Afghanistan has the potential to produce about 1,408 million cubic meters (MCM) of biogas annually, equivalent to about 32 trillion Btu which fulfills today\u2019s energy need of Afghanistan. The electrical energy from the combustible portion of the Municipal Solid Waste in Afghanistan\u2019s major urban areas, using thermo-chemical conversion, is estimated at 134 GWh per year. There is also 158,000 MW Wind potential i.e. 5 MW/Km2 in the country and great potential for solar power i.e. 300 Sunny Days, average 6.5 kWh/m2 per day solar radiation. \nWhat are some experiences of other developing countries in harnessing of renewable energy?\nKeeping that explanation in mind, what would be some economically viable and technically achievable strategies and techniques that can be applied in Afghanistan?\n\n",
