They would maintain a list of companies and contacts (generally employeers of 100 or more/or companies that the city didn't want to lose). They made the contact and someone from the EDB and a senior staff person (Administrator, Deputy, Community Devel. Director) would meet with them. It was pretty informal and focused on what's working? How's business? What challenges are you having? Is there anything we can do to help you? The EDB had expertise in workforce, taxation, capital, State regulation, and regional issues. The City rep. had expertise in permitting, transportation, traffic, utilities, marketing. It worked very well and people really appreciated the two different perspectives coming to visit. As a city person, it gave me a great insight to where business was at. Based on what we heard, we would often follow up with training or outreach to others. For example, when we kept hearing about employees who couldn't get to work, we worked with the transit providor to bring bus service.\n\n\nIn a prior community, we had a partnership with the Economic Development Council to do business retention meetings.

I am in the process of deciding whether or not this would be a good use of my organizations time and committment.  Also, if anyone has any information on the topic I would appreciate it.
