They may still be contracting and have probably issued more recent RFPs, so contacting them might be helpful. If you need more examples of local governments that have contracted for snow removal let me know (emoulder@icma.org).\nBest,  \nEvelina\n\n\nHello Bill,\n\nICMA is in the process of collecting data on service delivery for 2012, so I can't provide the latest, but the results from 2007 show that both Grant and Sparks, NV, contracted for snow removal in 2007.
