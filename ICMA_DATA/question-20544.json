  "text": "\n\nI am currently an Assistant Township Manager. Our Township Manager will be retiring effective November 27th.  The Township Council has asked me to serve has Acting Township Manager, effective Dec 1,  until they can complete the search process. In the past when the Manager has been out due to illness, I have acted in the capacity of Acting Township Manager. My question is now that there will no longer be a person appointed as Township Manager, should I be appointed as an Interim Manager or Acting Manager?\nOr is there no difference?\nThank you.\n\n",
