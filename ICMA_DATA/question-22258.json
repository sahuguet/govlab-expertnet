  "text": "\n\nWe used a \"Vacancy Rate Adjustment\" in balancing our 2012 Budget, and will be using one again in 2013 (calling it attrition savings this time though).  I know that GFOA Best Practices allow for this type of adjustment, in recognizing that not all positions are filled 52 weeks a year due to various circumstances.  This practice has allowed us to balance our budget, and has not caused any adverse effects to date. \nI am just wondering if any other cities have used a similar type of adjustment on the front-end as a budget balancing strategy?  What was your methodology for calculating the savings?  How long have you been using this practice?  Did it cause any confusion or concern among your elected officials when first proposed?  Did you ever overrun as a result of using this practice?\nAs I mentioned, this practice has been generally accepted and put into practice in our municipality, I am just wondering about others' experiences for informational purposes.  Any response is appreciated.\n\n",
