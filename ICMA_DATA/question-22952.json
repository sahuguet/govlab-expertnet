  "text": "\n\nOur City is considering the addition of a Business Services Director position to our staff.  This would be a department head level position that would supervise the type of functions that have direct contact with citizens/customers - utility billing, tax billing and collections, permitting, court, etc.  If anyone has a job description for a similar position (department head or not), it would be really helpful.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",
