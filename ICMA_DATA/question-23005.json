These companies (including mine) take a lot of time putting proposals together and they deserve a thorough review. Don't take shortcuts. Evaluate the ENTIRE proposal.  \nI am a former City Manager now Principal of an international consultancy. We have learned that if a local government does not have the interest or expertise in writing - let alone evaluating - an RFP, then they shouldn't be doing it in-house and should outsource (depending on the total value and long term impact of the project ). The saying, 'Garbage in, Garbage out' applies to many RFPs. If the proposal is garbage, then the responses will often reflect the same. Quality companies can identify a poorly-written RFP in 2-3 minutes and decide not to respond, leaving only those who thrive on such RFPs to respond. Evaluating those who do respond needs to be effective and thorough - testing their claims, thinking carefully about the methodology and conducting comprehensive backgrounds of the 3 top candidates. Don't let the appearance of a proposal outweigh methodology and accomplishments - get into the content and methodology. Many well-written proposals can mask a poor implementing team. In the end, it is the quality of the work and end result you are looking for - that should be your principal evaluation metric.   \nDavid, if you would like samples of evaluation tools, including thoughts on how to assemble your project team for draft and evaluation, let me know and I can share with you what we have developed and used. Comprehensive and complete RFP-writing and RFP-evaluation involves multiple key steps - you deserve to get them all right so your time, efforts and results are efficient, and successful.  Give me a call.  \nSee also  http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/5235/WiFi_RFPs_and_Vendor_Evaluation_Ask_the_Right_Questions_When_You_Prepare_for_Wireless_Internet\n\n\n@ Douglas, yes, reading through them is time consuming...but that's your job.

      "text": "\n\nDavid,    \nReading through many RFPs cover to cover can be quite time consuming.  This is kind of the methodology/key points I focus on:  does the proposal adequately address all the questions/ points in your RFP which you wrote or is it full of generic information which could be given to any community?  Spelling/grammatical errors are important to me because they provide a preliminary indication on the applicant's attention to detail-which could be crucial for the project plus it demonstrates the level of professionalism of the applicant and the amount of time put into your particular RFP.  I also try to ascertain if the applicant is qualified to do your specific project and does the applicant include comparable projects in their RFP and did those projects come in within or under the budgeted amount and on-time?  Has the applicant done projects in your region/state and where is the office located where they will be doing the work-how accessible will they be?  I think you need to look at the qualifications  of the main project leaders-have they managed a project similar to yours  in the past and do they have experience  with the applicable regulatory agencies?  Also make sure these same people show up for the interview if you select them for one.  Is the RFP personalized to your community-did the applicant do their research on your community,  review your plans,  goals,  etc.?  Did they visit your community and can you determine that by reading the RFP.  Finally, did the proposal include a WOW factor-something that really made you stop and think that would be great or I never would of thought of that.  Good luck!\n\n\nDavid,    \nReading through many RFPs cover to cover can be quite time consuming.

When designing an RFP for my clients I first tell them that professionals will be dedicating significant amounts of time and effort to answer these questions, and they will expect the issuer to do likewise.

To casually quote Sergeant Joe Friday, \"Nothing but the facts, ma'am\".  Maybe we should disregard \"ma'am\" for purposes of this response.  But if structured properly there should be few problems in the review.  \nI would caution that dependent on the technical or specialized nature of the RFP it may be necessary to have an evaluation team that is much more familiar with the issuer's service needs.  If I am evaluating doctors and hospitals for my upcoming brain surgery my brother-in-law, who is a preacher, is not typically a good resource for assisting me in that process.\n\n\nThis is an excellent question.

  "text": "\n\nIn general, how do those responsible for evaluating RFP responses for municipalities perform this task?  Do you usually read through a whole proposal, or do you key on certain elements such as an executive summary or pricing information?  When reviewing a proposal from an unfamiliar vendor, are there certain things that you may look for specifically to validate them?  Are there any explicit things within a vendors response that would cause you to automatically dismiss them from a bid?  Is there perhaps any advice that you would provide a vendor submitting a proposal to your municipality?\nI'd really appreciate your thoughts and insights.\nThank you!\nDavid Thurnau\n\n",
