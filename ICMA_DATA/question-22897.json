  "text": "\n\nWith the aid of a vinyl cutter and printer, the City of Galveston Planning Department's administrative staff found a creative sustainable reuse of bandit signs.  With what appears to be an endless supply of free viny material found on street right-of-way and utility poles, the administrative assistants gathered illegal signs and created some amazing holiday decorations!  Rather than filling the landfills with the illegal vinyl signs, the material can be repurposed and provide a potential fundraising opportunity for local non-profits and schools.\n\n",
