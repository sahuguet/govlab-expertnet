Upper levels of the parking garage are reserved for county staff.\n   Parking is free to the public at all 15 County Library branch locations. At our Main Library there is a staff only parking area, and designated parking for the public. The only time it is necesary to enforce parking for library patrons is when a golf tournament is held across the street at the Trump International Golf Course. During those events, we post signs restricting parking lot use to library patrons, and have a security guard on call to enforce the rule. Unauthorized over-night or extended parking is not allowed at any county facility.\n\n\nThe Palm Beach County, FL, Government Center Complex Parking Policy provides metered public parking from the 6 a.m. to midnight ($.75 per half hour) on the first level of the parking garage and in an uncovered lot.
