  "text": "\n\nWashington City is in the process of doing some updates to it's land use or general plan.  This is not a complete overhaul, but rather a review of certain land areas and sections of the plan.  I am interested in any cities that have written established procedures for these updates.  In particular; how and when do you involve the public, council and commission involvement, etc.  In short, anyone who has written procedures on this process I would appreciate getting a copy of.\nThanks,\nRoger Carter\nCity Manager \nrcarter@washingtoncity.org\n\n",
