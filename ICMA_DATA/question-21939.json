Carrollton, TX has done this for about a decade and is always the first that comes to mind - they even have a \"director of competition\" position. Having city staff bid against contractors keeps both sides competitive in the long run, and prevents it going completely to either public or private keeping service delivery high and lowering costs.\n\n\nThere are a few communities who have used \"managed competition\" to benchmark against private sector/outsourcing.

  "text": "\n\nThe City's Water Utility has been financially strained for several years and will remain so based on what we are projecting out into the future. I am in the process of developing a plan of action to address the situation, and feel that all options should be on the table for discussion. \nOne option that has not been presented yet is privatizing water and sewer utilities. I don't know yet if this is a feasible option that would address the issues, but would like to hear what others have learned in either exploring the idea or implementing a privatized solution.\nQuestions I currently have are:  1) what was the process used to make the decision, select the private contractor, and implement the deal? 2) What  parts of the process would you do differently and what was very successful? 3) Did you hire a consultant to assist in assess the feasibility of privatization? 4) How did you select a consultant and/or the eventual contractor? 5) What were the major political concerns and how were they addressed? 6) Are you satisfied with the services?\n\n",
