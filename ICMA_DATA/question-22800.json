There aren't many joint 211-311 call centers outside of New York City.  One of the primary reasons why is the very different types of calls being handled.  311 calls are generally short in duration, taking perhaps 1-2 minutes.  211 calls require agents to ask questions and probe a bit into the needs of the individuals calling.  These calls can extend into the 5-10 minute range and longer depending on the nature of why a person is calling.\nWith respect to the processes to address awareness, access, etc., we do have an InFocus Report on 311/CRM systems that might be helpful.  It's available in the bookstore (http://bookstore.icma.org/product1.cfm?Product_ID=2311 ) that outlines the steps a community should take to assess whether it's ready for 311 service.\nPlease give me a call if you want to talk a bit more about this topic or just do some brainstorming.\nCory\n(207-854-1083; cfleming@icma.org)\n\n\nHi Nikola, \n\nICMA released the attached white paper on the 211-311 connection a while back now, but the findings are still worth reviewing.

  "text": "\n\nHello all!\nOur City Manager recently asked myself and another co-worker to develop a process which we could recommend to him and council that would answer the following question: Do community members in our community know how to access current systems in place like the 211 center and government services in order to meet their needs?\nWe currently have the 211 service but not the 311. \nI'm wondering if anyone has good examples of processes they used in their communities around 211 and 311 services that address awareness, access and sustainability of these services? I'm very interested in processes that are community/stakeholder based both in information/data gathering stages and implementation of determined solutions/actions. \nThank you in advance for your contributions. \nNikola\n\n",
