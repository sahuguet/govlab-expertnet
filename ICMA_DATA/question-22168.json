  "text": "\n\nI am looking for any resources that might help to develop standards for custodial services, both in-house and contracted.  Specifically, any good resources to determine staffing needs or cost for servicing facilities based on building, use, or occupancy data (ie, how long should it take to clean a building with 47 offices, etc...)  Any help is appreciated!\n\n",
