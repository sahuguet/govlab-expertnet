Initiatives are supported from the City Council and City Manager's office to the staff, volunteer and appointed boards, to the community.  Here are some links as a start.  Most of these documents discuss city HR functions as well as community-wide projects.  You may have to sift through to find specifics more closely related to your particular question, but you get a good sense of how the City addresses diversity and inclusion.  Ms. Kelly Larson is the Human Rights Director there and she may be available to assist in your research.  Best to you and greetings to all back at SOG, btw.  http://www.cityofdubuque.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/3623 http://www.cityofdubuque.org/DocumentCenter/View/16041  http://www.cityofdubuque.org/index.aspx?NID=1046\n\n\nMegan,\nThe City of Dubuque has been doing this for a number of years and does it well.
