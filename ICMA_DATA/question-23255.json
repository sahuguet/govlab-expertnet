While the NCS is not a \"do it yourself\" survey, it is proven methodology and also allows for benchmarking of results from local governments across the country.  Given the economy of scale reached by utilizing a survey that is widely used by local governments, you may find that the cost is reasonable for you. \nAdditionally, I would echo the suggestion on the use of the Peak Democracy Open Town Hall product as another option for survey outreach to the community.    It is a different approach than the NCS, but offers a different kind of opportunity for you to consider.  \nInformation on both of these products can be found by visiting the Center for Management Strategies website at www.icma.org/strategies .
