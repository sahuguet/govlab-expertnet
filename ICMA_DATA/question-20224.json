We were able to do this, in part, because our police department made effective use of online training opportunities.   For the coming year, we've proposed reinstatement of most of the travel budget, although we will continue to use online services wherever possible.  Through our first budget workshop, Council has seemed supportive of restoring the funding, but time will tell.  \nWe're fortunate in that our Council is made up of well-educated, professional/executive people who understand the importance of investment in the organizations human resources.  That's also a theme I continually drive home in budget presentations and informal discussions with Council.  We are careful, as we return from training opportunities, to impart to Council what was learned that will benefit the organization and how it will benefit the city.  That helps them continually see the value of funding travel/training.\n\n\nWe are an extremely small organization (22 employees).

However, we did not want to minimize the importance of personal and professional development and began what we call University of Collinsville.  UC's Mission is to promote and provide an organizational culture that embraces lifelong learning.  UC contributes to one of our Strategic Goals...  the goal of being a provider of superior services.  In doing so we offer employees tools they can use to become top quality professionals; all while encouraging personal and professional development.  It is our hope that we can therefore sustain a competent city workforce and we make it fun all a the same time.  We have partnered with local universities and have brought in outside trainers.  We have even went so far to use our very own employees to teach classes on power point and tips for giving presentations, excel, customer service and this semester internal staff members will be teaching employees on our performance management model, process improvement, Baldrige and concept of High Performance.  Our employees receive certificates at the completion and provide feedback on what courses they would like to see incorporated.  This has also helped us save significantly because now we can offer courses to a variety of employees instead of sending one or two to seminars and is essentially more cost effective for the long-term.  We have had discussions of expanding and enhancing this effort to allow other taxing districts within the City or even other local communities register for courses and essentially make it a self-sustaining effort.  Employees have really embraced this effort and we usually have a full-house.  I have attached this semester's coursebook for you to reference.\n\n\nOur organization limited travel to the region and in some cases travel was allowed within the state.

Some training is frivolous, but that's as true in-state as out-of-state.  In conjunction with the employee's annual review, we prepare a training plan, specifically identifying training needed to achieve that year's performance goals (over and above job competence).  Typically such training costs about 5% of annual compensation, which is how we budget.  It is not difficult to show Council that we get at least a 100% ROI on that training investment.\n\n\nTraining is a force multiplier, and we treat it like computer support: we need the tools to do our work well.

If so, how do you continue to encourage professional development?  How successful have alternative forms of professional development been (webinars, phone conferences, publications, etc)?  \nIf your travel budgets have not been reduced lately, what has your strategy been to make travel spending a priority?  Any thoughts are appreciated - thank you!\n\n",
