      "text": "\n\nI couldn't agree more with Sandra!  Emotional intelligence allows a manager to understand how employees are receiving their particular management style/approach, how to motivate employees, as well as being able to treat team members as individuals.  It is important as managers that we understand that we may have to alter our communication and management styles with each employee in order to have them produce the best work possible.  Each employee is an individual and thus responds differently.  Emotional intelligence (including the ability to pick up on non-verbal cues) allows the manager to sense each of his employees reactions to management decisions in a way that produces the highest quality of work.  I believe high emotional intelligence is a key indicator of not only a good manager, but of a good leader.  A manager who cannot understand the feelings and levels of happiness of his/her staff will not only disengage staff members, but will not be able to redirect poor management decisions.\n\n\nI couldn't agree more with Sandra!

Is there a benefit to more old-fashioned language like empathy, compassion, warmth, or civility?
