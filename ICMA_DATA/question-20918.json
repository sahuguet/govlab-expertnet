      "text": "\n\nI can only speak for California as in the US the national government does not normally or directly regulate local or state government except for compliance with the Constitution.  Most of the regulation occurs through financial incentive's, if you don't comply, federal funds will be withheld from your state or local.  their are  exceptions like the environmental, fair employment and health-care laws.  California does not have a centralized ethics oversight structure.  Th FPPC (Fair Political Practices Commission oversees campaign contribution and individual gift limits.  The county district attorney oversees compliance with most state laws affecting local government such as compliance with open meeting laws, bribery charges, financial corruption.  The state also has a number of other agencies responsible for parts of the issue such as the controllers office, secretary of state and attorney generals office.  The state requires local agencies to have an ethics code for elected officials, but its enforcement is limited.  City manager ethics are overseen by ICMA and it's code of Ethics.  While ICMA has said it will investigate non-members, it is extremely reluctant to do so such as in the case of Bell, California in which action was taken against the city manager as a member of ICMA, but none against the assistant city manager who is not a member. (I think members and non-members should be held accountable by ICMA for their actions.  While you can't expel a non-member, you can publicly criticize their conduct.  If the concern is ICMA will get sued, in the US being afraid of being sued would mean you would do or say nothing ever.  Also, public figures in the US and California have very little legal recourse for public rebuke, especially if it is their actions being challenged and not their person.)  I think the state would be served best to consolidate all enforcement with the county district attorney as the DA in each county will be more familiar with the agencies and officials and what is going on then someone in the state capital.   I also think the public will be more inclined to report issue to the DA then to a multitude of agencies.  The current system is so diversified, even someone fairly familiar with the system could not be certain who has jurisdiction.  Not a perfect solution as the DA is an elected official and their actions are influenced by politics, but a better solution then the one we have currently.  You still need someone like ICMA as violating the law is different then violating ethics.  Actions can be legal, but completely unethical.\nRod Wood, ICMA-CM\nLegacy Leader ICMA\n\n\nI can only speak for California as in the US the national government does not normally or directly regulate local or state government except for compliance with the Constitution.

Currently we are undertaking a review of our Standards Panel, which acts to investigate allegations orfbreach of conduct by members of various local government authorities.\nAs part of the review, we are looking into similar panels/committees in other jurisdictions, specifically the UK and the US. However, I have been struggling to find any information about whether a similar committee or panel exists at any level of government within the US. \nAny direction into this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nnb - I have included a link below  as a point of reference for the equivalent in the UK.\nhttp://www.standardsforengland.gov.uk\n\n",
