Just a cautionary tale that, just as the traditional information outlets service a certain segment of your citizenry, social media outlets or web-sites will do the same thing. They will service a slice of your citizenry that might not currently be involved.\nIn my opinion, there is no one site or location to increase citizen participation. You have to work all of them, traditional media outlets (ie, radio, newspapers, organization newsletters), Twitter, Facebook, youtube etc. Jurisdictions website. They are all just pieces of the puzzle. The problem with many of these portals is context and nuance is lost, so it forces you to be more focused to get results.\nIn my previous position, I was the first County Auditor in the State of Washington to have a Facebook account detailing my office (we administered elections, finance, vehicle licensing, and recording of documents), the first with a Twitter account, the first County Auditor to create a county newsletter that we mailed to postal customer( this was not that expensive because we only had 11,000 residents).\nThe key I found was to be sincere, but I caution you, that the more you use non-traditional media outlets, that the traditional ones will get upset, ie newspaper, radio, tv, etc especially if you are in a small community. Because the bread and butter of a local newspaper is the goings-on of government, and if you can bypass their filter to get the people the news they need, the traditional media might not be in business for long.\nJust be careful how you handle this, I handled it in a manner that was very damaging personally and would have been much more delicate in how I do things in the future.\n\n\nIt has been my experience that Facebook and Twitter can be tools to engage citizen input and involvement.

      "text": "\n\nI agree with John.  \nSocial Networking sites are some of the first things that come to mind because they are free with relatively low maintenance, providing a means in which two-way communication is simplified.  People feel engaged when they feel that someone is listening.  This is important even in the cyberworld.  The City of Eustis, Florida is a good example of this.  The only difference between my experience and John's is that our local news media outlets have cut back to the point that they actually get their news leads from our City's Facebook and Twitter entries.  When they want more detail, they call me.\nIt is important to note also that even though a City's website is generally considered one-way communication, it is beneficial that it be updated frequently so that people have a place to go for the latest - greatest info.  People usually visit a static site once.\n\n\nI agree with John.  \n\nSocial Networking sites are some of the first things that come to mind because they are free with relatively low maintenance, providing a means in which two-way communication is simplified.
