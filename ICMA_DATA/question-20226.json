I agree completely with the comments above, ICMA and the regional associations are a great place to start and make contacts. In most area of the country a Master degree is a great help in getting your foot in the door. One of the good things, in my opinion, is there are many ways to get started in the field but several characteristics seem to always be part of the path: Commitment, starting often as an intern/volunteer, always seeking knowledge/responsibility, and finding a mentor already in the field. Good luck!\n\n\nJay - Happy to hear your choice of a career in city Management.

I am fortunate enough at my age to know that I want to pursue a career in city management and become a city manager one day. I was wondering if anyone has any idea's on a good leap from community management to city management and what type of positions I should look for? Is there any education I can pursue in the meantime? I plan to make the leap in a few years and would greatly appreciateany advise on how to further qualify myself and the types of positions I should pursue.\n\n",
