Below is the link to Iowa\u2019s policy.\nhttp://policy.iastate.edu/policy/conflict/vendors\nIn Texas they also ban such situations and the link below goes to more information about the documents they use in conjunction with their policy.\nhttp://www.ethics.state.tx.us/whatsnew/conflict_forms.htm\nAlso, I found another example of this type of policy from the University of California, Santa Cruz. While the bottom half deals with family, employees, and vendors, the top has some general wording you might find useful.\nhttp://purchasing.ucsc.edu/howto/employeevendorpolicy.html\nI have also included two general documents from the ICMA Knowledge Network. One which highlights some of the common vendor- government relations pit falls and the other the Vendor Manual from Miami Dade County, Florida. \nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/2236/Avoiding_Pitfalls_with_Vendors_and_Advisory_Groups\nhttp://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/documents/kn/Document/7070/Ethics_Guide_for_Businesses_MiamiDade_County_Florida\nI hope these offer you some help while writing your own policy.\nAli Iannolo\nICMA Knowledge Network Intern\naiannolo@ICMA.org\n\n\nHello,\nI have done some research on your question and found some sites that may be useful to you.\nThe Iowa State University has the state\u2019s vendor policy posted on their website since it extends to them as well.
