  "text": "\n\nI am seeking information from public agencies that have successfully constructed a trail/greenway through a golf course or, along the edge of the golf course where golf course land was needed to build the project. \nIf you have built a similar project or are designing one, I\u2019d love to hear about your partnerships, successes and challenges. I\u2019m particularly interested in projects where the golf course is privately owned. \nThank you!\n\n",
