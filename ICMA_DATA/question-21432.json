  "text": "\n\nI am interested in guidance on the development of department head evaluation and performance measurement practices which encourage goal setting, year over year improvements, responsiveness to the public, and advancement of strategic goals as determined by the Board of Trustees and the Village Manager. We are looking for a non-threatening process that brings good discipline to performance reviews while ensuring that the strategic goals of our Village and our obligation to customer responsiveness are being met.\nAn adjunct to the above is guidance on how to develop coherent and actionable strategic goals from a Board of Trustees which can be leveraged into evaluation practices for the Village Manager and at the Department Head level.\n\n",
