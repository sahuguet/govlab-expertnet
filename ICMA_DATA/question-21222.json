The city of Peoria, Arizona, began by requiring the inclusion of performance information in budget justifications a few years ago, which is outlined briefly in the attached mini case study. The cities of Austin, Texas, and Bellevue, Washington, are two that have among the most mature performance measurement programs, although I don't know if they're doing exactly what you describe. If I find other examples, I'll post them here. Thanks for the question.\n\n\nBill-Great question. Some participants in the ICMA Center for Performance Measurement have been moving in this direction.

      "text": "\n\nAs a consultant I've encountered many variations in using performance measures to evaluate budget decisions.  GFOA has an excellent March 2011 publication \"Anatomy of a Priority Driven Budget Process\" that outlines the basic concepts of both priority based budgeting and budgeting for outcomes .  In these methodologies the importance of a program's proposed outcomes is considered in relation to broader outcomes or results established at the City or County level.  See the GFOA site at:  http://www.gfoaconsulting.org/downloads/GFOAWhitepaper_AnatomyofaPriority-Driven%20BudgetProcess_March2011.pdf \nMore fundamentally, performance measures should be used to describe the expected level of performance for budgeted programs and activiites/services (more localities budget at the program level but \"drilling down\" to the level of activities or services provides better ability to connect resources to services).  Your Fairfax County budget is a good example of one that provides a full \"family of measures\" for programs complete with past performance and projected performance for the year being budgeted.  It's especially useful when localities construct program objectives and measures so they describe the level of service that is achieved with a budgeted amount.  Programs can then be asked to describe the impact of funding changes on service levels.  For example with its base budget funding a development services program might be able to review 90% or more of development plans within 10 days.  If funding reductions must be considered, the program can project how this level of service will change.  Hope this is helpful.\n\n\nAs a consultant I've encountered many variations in using performance measures to evaluate budget decisions.
