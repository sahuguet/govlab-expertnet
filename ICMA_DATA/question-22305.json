  "text": "\n\nWe are considering reformatting our 700 page budget book from being primarily developed for a print version to an on-line version and are looking for feedback from other municipalities who have already made this change.  What did you do to make the document easier to read when viewing on a computer screen instead of on paper?  What worked?  What did not work?  How did you demonstrate performance management with your budget document?   What software(s) did you use?  What feedback (positive and negative) did you received from readers?  Any and all experiences would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
