I also hope that after the holidays some other local government officials can chime in and give you first hand advice on the redesign vendors they have used and their experiences with them. \n-Here are two RFPs for website redesign vendors from Aspen, CO and from Burlingame, CA that you may find useful. (Aspen icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/14843) ( Burlingame icma.org/Documents/Document/Document/14340)\n-Here is a previously asked question where local government officials provided evaluations methods for how a local government can evaluate website redesign proposals. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/kn/Question/20609\n-Here is a previously asked question where a local government official asked how citizens could be involved in the website redesign process. You can learn how different local governments went about getting citizen input. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/kn/Question/21010/Citizen_Engagement__Participation_in_the_Website_Redesign_Process\n-Here is a previously asked question about surveys regarding website redesign. http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/kn/Question/22892/Website_Redesign_Survey\nI hope you find these resources helpful and that other Knowledge Network users chime in after the holidays are over.\n\n\nHi Susan, \n\nThank you for your question on website redesign.

      "text": "\n\nHi Susan,  \nThe Town of Farragut, TN  (www.townoffarragut.org) underwent a  re-design three years ago.  After a comprehensive RFQ/P process we selected CivicPlus as the most qualified firm.  They have really cornered the market with governmental website hosting/design..particularly local government.  Overall, we are happy with CivicPlus' Content Management System (CMS).  They have an outstanding document center and user-friendly interface so you don't need to be a web design expert to maintain the website.  They have a decent Citizen Request Tracker module (and mobile device app) for citizen complaints.  Their online pay module and reservation calendar module (sports etc.) has not worked for us which has been a source of frustration....thus, we will have to buy a third party app for those activities and link it through the website.  Attached is our contract.  Feel free to contact me at gpalmer@townoffarragut.org for any further info.  Good luck!!\n\n\nHi Susan,  \n\nThe Town of Farragut, TN  (www.townoffarragut.org) underwent a  re-design three years ago.

I think our original cost back in 2009 was around $45K but it could be more or less depending on how much content on the existing site you want them to migrate.  Our goal was to have a website that departments could easily maintain on their own and not require our Tech department to be involved in every website change.   From my research, both the Vision and Civic Plus CMS systems provide this type of easy access/edit capability.\n\n\nWe also use Vision Internet and overall have been satisfied.

You could have a theme designed for you, find a free one, or buy one. \nI personally wouldn't tie myself down to one of the proprietary options mentioned above. Why pay a yearly fee and be locked into what they offer? WordPress (and I believe Drupal) has a huge community around it with developers creating plugins (free and paid) and themes (free and paid) that are independent of WordPress. What I mean is is that because the source code for WordPress is public, people can create themes and it is not just WordPress (or Drupal) doing that work giving you many, many options. WordPress also has several major releases a year and are constantly improving the system. \nI don't know nearly as much about Drupal, but the federal government uses it, and it's a popular choice.\nI'll step off my soap box now! ;)\n\n\nHave you considered open source and go with Drupal or WordPress?

Our internal clients/STAFF are thrilled with the ease of use and functionality, we're serving our USERS better with more features and capabilities (plus moving to a more topically focused website & better content), and all at a LOWER COST with more flexibility going forward . Our homepage and other major parts of the public website will convert in the next few weeks.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Corpus Christi may soon be moving to a redesign of our website and an offsite hosting service. I was unable to attend the ICMA conference this year to check out the vendors for this service. If your city has a great website design and hosting service, please send that information my way.  Also, please let me know the cost of the redesign and any operating expenses related to site maintenance and updates. I appreciate your help.\n\n",
