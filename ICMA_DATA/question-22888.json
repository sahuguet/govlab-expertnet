We have event listings, maps, parking information, local offers by businesses, and of course, city information, including a form to report problems.  Please download our app from Google Play or the App Store and check it out. We worked with www.citizensync.com to build the app.  The total first year cost was about $4,000 (split three ways by the partners).  Annual maintenance will be about $1,000.  The advantage of working with Citizen Sync is the ongoing support ... we just e-mail new events or other updates and they do the rest.\n\n\nThe City of Oberlin, in partnership with the Oberlin business community and Oberlin College, developed a mobile app to be the one stop for visitors, residents, college students, etc. to go for information about the City, College, and local businesses.

I have found some great resources online but I would like to learn more about how apps are being used in smaller cities. The City of Fairburn, GA has a population of about 14,000. \nWhat was your experience with this process? What did you like? What did you dislike? What would you do different? What is the cost associated with creation and implementation? Do your residents seem to like this feature?\nAny information that you can provide is greatly appreciated. \nThanks,\n\n",
