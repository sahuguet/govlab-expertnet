I've been looking into this exact question, and based on my research, I would recommend the following:\n\nAvailability: Percentage of time the equipment is up and running during the hours it is needed (e.g. a refuse truck would have 100% availability if it were fully functioning during the hours of collection, say 6:30a to 5p).\nUtilization: The number of miles/hours a piece of equipment is being used compared to other equipment of the same class/relative age.\nMaintenance/Repair Ratio:  The percentage of total maintenance and repair costs that is spent on PM work as opposed to repairs or unscheduled maintenance.\n\nI am sure there are many other good measures, but these are the ones I generally see consultants, and industry groups recommending.\n\n\nI don't work directly for the Fleet Department, but I am the Solid Waste Department Fleet Analyst.

CPM has over 180 local government participants nationwide, so we have a fairly comprehensive representation of fleet managers from all over. As a part of our survey effort we asked all of our participants to suggest which measures they felt were 'core' to determining the performance of a fleet management system. Here is what they came up with: \n-Hours Billed per Vehicle or Piece of Equipment Maintained by the Central Fleet Management Operation\n-Hours Billed as a Percentage of Hours Available\n-Total maintenance expenditures vs. preventative maintenance for each class of vehicles (Does preventive maintenance really hold down the costs of unexpected repairs?)\n- Expenditures per mile for each class vehicle\n- % of vehicles exceeding a pre-specified replacement criteria\n- Employees rating of the quality of fleet management services (employees from other departments.)\nWith any of these measures you really need to be careful of the amount of difficulty involved with collecting the measures. At CPM we have avoided using availability as a measure, because we find that for many of our participants that number is just too difficult to count. Instead we encourage our participants to set replacement criteria, then track how many vehicles fall outside that criteria. Also, while measuring down time may tell you what percentage of the time a vehicle is available for use, it does not indicate how this timeliness is perceived by the customers (other departmental staff). Ultimately, it is these employees who are the deciding factor in whether the fleet maintenance department is providing them with the tools that they need to serve their constituents and get their job done. That is why we encourage all of our jurisdictions to survey all of their employees in order to determine the performance of internal service areas.\nFor more information on CPM and internal surveys visit: www.icma.org/performance and http://icma.org/en/results/surveying/\n\n\nPerformance of Fleet Management departments is one service area that we survey annually as a part of the ICMA's Center for Performance Measurement.
