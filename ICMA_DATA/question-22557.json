  "text": "\n\nOur City is currently completing a comprehensive compensation and benefit study to see where our organization falls in various identified markets and positions. \nWe would then like to use this information to create a policy statement adopted by our Governing Body that set the high level philosophy of how our organization will compensate and provide benefits going forward (it may be similar to what we already do, but will now be formalized). This policy statement would serve at a higher level than a pay plan, but would guide our work in developing our pay plan. \nDoes anyone have a similar policy statement type document that captures your Governing Body\u2019s philosophy on compensation and benefits that can share with us? Thank you in advance.\n\n",
