  "text": "\n\nI'm looking for resources related to the management of an Event Center owned by a municipality.  The facility seats approximately 10,000 people and is used for a variety of events; sports, concerts, trade shows, etc.  The facility is currently operated by a third-party management firm.  We are trying to decide what the best management options might be moving forward (switch management companies, bring the management \"in house\").  I would very much appreciate any information that might be provided related to handling the transition (private to private or private to public), governance (municipality setting up some type of management entity), and other related items.\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
