  "text": "\n\nCurrently the City of Novi is reviewing our processes for accepting payments for miscellaneous receivables (admission at events and Parks, Posting bond, various charges associated with Police operations, etc.). We are looking to expand our options for accepting alternative means of payment through credit cards, PayPal, payments through an iPhone/iPad and other means.\nI\u2019m wondering what methods your departments use for miscellaneous receivables? Do any of your departments have a mobile means of accept credit card payments (an iPhone/iPad app or a hand-held device)?  (For our Michigan Colleagues) Does your chosen solution interact well with BS&A for those who subscribe to BS&A?  \nAny information you could provide would be very helpful. Thank you in advance.\nJohn McCarter\nCity of Novi\nManagement Analyst Graduate Intern\n\n",
