Please contact me if you have a successful ADA program, or you can just send me copies of documentation regarding your program.  Documentation that could really help us would be:  Procedures for the Self-Assessment, job description of the ADA coordinator, or brochures that describe your program.\nAny help and guidance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.\nTHANKS\n\n",
