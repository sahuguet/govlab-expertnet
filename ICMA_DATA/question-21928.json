  "text": "\n\nMy city is in the process of establishing a cultural district in our historic downtown area, and we are interested in developing a sidewalk cafe / outdoor dining ordinance to complement the cultural activities.  The ordinance primarily would address code and standards issues related to outdoor dining on sidewalk areas as well as issues related to outdoor alcohol consumption (open containers are currently prohibited downtown).\nI have found some excellent sidewalk cafe ordinances so far in my research, but  I was hoping that ICMA members might point me towards some I might not have found yet.\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
