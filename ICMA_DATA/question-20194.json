We decided we should try to hire a consultant to do the work for us.  A strategy that worked for us was to contact some public universities in Virginia to see if they were interested in the work.  An advantage of this strategy is that if we entered into an agreement with a Public university we would not have to go through a formal procurement process.  This helped because it saved time in selecting a vendor.  We got the contact information for key persons at the universities, and then sent letters inviting them to contact us to set up an interview so that we could tell them more about the community assessment we wanted to do.  After the interview, intersted universities were invited to send us a proposal.  We met with folks from 3 universities.  Only one was interested in the project, and they also had experience that related to the research that needed to be done.  Perhaps looking to local universities could benefit you.\n\n\nIn Loudoun Co.
