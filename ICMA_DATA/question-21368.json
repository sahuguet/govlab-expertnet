  "text": "\n\nThe Hallandale Beach Florida Charter review Board is recommending the City Clerk be appointed by and report directly to the City Council.  Currently, and for the past 60 plus years the City Clerk has been appointed by and reported to the City Manager.  The rationale for the board's recommendation is for a few reasons but mainly centers around what they refer to as excessive time to obtain records and timely completion of minutes.  The current manager, mayor and one ex-city councilmember are recommending the City Clerk continue to be appointed by and and report to the City Manager.\nQuestion: I would be interested in having feedback from managers and assistants who have had prior experiences with both situations where the city Clerk reported to the manager and the City Clerk reported to the council.  I would be interested in knowing the following:\n1.  In your opinion, what would differences between the two scenarios?\n2.  Were there any organizational problems resulting from the council appointment?\n3.  Were there any budgetary or financial issues that differed between the two scenarios?\n4.  Any other information you could add would be greatly appreciated.\nI am currently writing a book on city management and your feedback would be welcomed.\n\n",
