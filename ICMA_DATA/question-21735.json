For example, in Westchester County we encountered large group of day laborers on a regular basis in the Central Business District.  We worked to understand who was represented in the group (it is not sufficient to use Census terms in describing groups, you will need to be more specific to a country); and then to attempt to understand what it is that they are seeking.  By better understanding those elements, you might have a better shot at getting community support in working on collabortive projects with them and the community at large.\nPeter Block also has written on approaches similar to that, and you might look at his books.  (Community of Understanding, etc)\nGood luck.  Hope this delayed response finds some usefulness.\n\n\nNiel,\nOne sized answer will not fit all situations, but we have had some success in bringing the groups together on topics in which they may share an interest first; so that we have an on-going dialogue when a crisis situation arises.
