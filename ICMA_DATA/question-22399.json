      "text": "\n\nVincent, here in Las Cruces NM we have developed some models to prioritize capital projects for our buildings and streets/drainage projects.  In the case of buildings, for example, the condition of the infrastructure is assessed (system components are rated from 1-5), deferred maintenance and replacement costs are calcuated, and then weighting factors (public use, public impact, health and safety) are applied to yield a ranked list of buildings/systems in need of capital renewal.  There is a similar process for streets/drainage systems with the weighting factors including level of use (collectors, arterials, etc.).  The output from these models, which are analytically-based, serves as a good guideline for objective capital project prioritization.\n\n\nVincent, here in Las Cruces NM we have developed some models to prioritize capital projects for our buildings and streets/drainage projects.

We have found some best practices through general searches on the web of other government agencies, but are also hoping that there are some ICMA members that may have pertinent capital project review criteria, plans, process, etc. that can be shared as well.
