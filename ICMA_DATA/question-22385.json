Also we also posted a question on this topic in our OpenArington forum, operated by Peak Democracy -- openarlington.us -- 47 responses thus far.\nThe Arlington County Urban Agriculture Initiative Citizen Task Force is researching this very question.  We have reviewed literature from many jurisdictions across the country and in Europe.  We have also spoken with public health, animal welfare, and animal husbandry experts in addition to public advocacy groups pro and con.  We have not yet reached a consensus on a recommendation for whether to loosen the current restrictions on poultry (or other small livestock) in Arlington, but some of the factors were are examining include:\n\nHen registration fee and permit\nPre-approval of coop and run plan and location\nInspection of same prior to permitting\nPermission of all neighbors required\nLimit number of hens, prohibit roosters\nRequire minimum distance (TBD) from property lines\nEducation program on henkeeping -- required or optional\nTest program with a limited pilot\n\nWill protocols such as the above, if enforced properly, eliminate or minimize public health, rodents, noise, odor, predators and other considerations?  How will the program be monitored and what is the enforcement scheme.  How much will all this cost?  It is worth it?\nThe current code in Arlington actually does not prohibit small livestock per se, but the setback restrictions effectively do so.  I think at last count only 11 private properties were large enough.  I do not think any of these actually have livestock.\nOur recommendations are due to the CBO in April.\nLet me know if I can provide any further information!\n\n\nThe below information is actually from my colleague, Kim Haun (khaun@arlingtonva.us), who works in our Parks and Recreation Department.
