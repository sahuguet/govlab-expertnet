  "text": "\n\nWe are examining the possibility of implementing an Ethics Hotline, and would appreciate any examples of successful programs currently in existence. \nDoes your organization use a third-party vendor for anonymous reporting of ethics violations? Which one, what is the cost of using such a tool, and how much internal staff time and/or O&M cost is there in addition to the third-party vendor's services? Finally, what is the size of your organization?\nThank you in advance!\n\n",
