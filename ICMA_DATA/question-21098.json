      "text": "\n\nPam,\nA good place to start the conversation is around your community's mission. Ask yourself what business(es) you want to be in, and what services could potentially be delivered more efficiently and cost-effectively by someone else. \nAs part of a routine continuous improvement process, we usually suggest folks look at the \"low-hanging fruit\" first. In this case that would mean mean departments where you're having difficulty meeting budget or complying with regulations, or departments where you experience higher turnover or surveys show lower citizen satisfaction. \nGiven that in today's economy cities and counties have had to reduce staff in some departments, these would be another area to examine early on. For example, if development has halted in your community, you may have had to reduce your plan review staff. Will you be able to staff back up when the economy improves? Probably not right away so this would be a good time to look at electronic plan review to reduce the number of staff needed and/or outsourcing to a firm can staff up and down as the economy dictates.\nHope this helps!\nSusan \nsusan.mays@ch2m.com\n\n\nPam,\n\nA good place to start the conversation is around your community's mission.
