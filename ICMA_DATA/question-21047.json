MEDAT is not instituted on every project, the Directors of Economic Development Bill and Development and Sustainability need to agree on the positive impact and \u201cspecial\u201d needs of the project before the resources are deployed.  Typically a business will benefit from a customized timeline and direct interaction with department decision makers.\nIn addition, the Economic Development staff acts as a facilitator between the business community and the City.  If there are specific issues/questions across any topic we\u2019ll typically run with it and get back to the business.  We engage appropriate staff from various departments/agencies when necessary.  A specific example of how the City is proactive with this concept is the Downtown Mesa coordination team which is comprised of representatives from planning, engineering, transportation, City Manager\u2019s office, Arts & Cultural and Economic Development.  The team meets bi-weekly to discuss everything and anything Downtown related (Light Rail, Central Main Street Plan, Special Events, etc).  When issues arise, including issues with specific businesses, appropriate City staff are briefed and called upon to help resolve the issue.\n\n\nFrom a business attraction standpoint we have the Mesa Economic Development Action Team (MEDAT) that addresses the needs of specific projects.
