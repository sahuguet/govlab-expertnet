Such processes as formatting and cleaning up data can most likely be automated using visual basic for applications (the programming tool included with MS Office).  Admittedly, the likelihood of most organizations having ready access to someone familiar with VBA is slim.  Depending upon how many different formats you are dealing with, it may be a relatively easy fix.  In fact, if you are only dealing with one or two different formats, I'd even be willing to take a stab at it for you (no guarantees!).  If it's doable, I can send you or your staff a file with the automation process baked in, so it would only require a click of the mouse to \"auto format/clean\" an exported data set.  Would you like to provide me with an unformatted data set so I can take a crack?\nSincerely,\nTom\n\n\nArnoldo,\n\nI enjoyed your question.

Task them to find the right application for your agency and they'll figure it out based on a true understanding of data analysis and presentation.

  "text": "\n\nDoes your municipality utilize any third party software to analyze extracted data sets and then express characteristics such as frequency, duration, average, mean, etc?  Excel is a good start but it has its limitations especially how much the data needs to be formatted correctly and cleaned up.  Looking for affordable examples that could be used by a few staffers.  The data can help with performance measures and process improvement studies.\nThank you,\nArnold\n\n",
