The inventory will ask questions such as: What surveys does your department send? To whom? How frequently? What kinds of questions do you ask? How are the results used?\nHas your municipality administered this kind of \u201csurvey of surveys\u201d? If so, what suggestions or advice would you give?\nThanks in advance for your responses.\n\n",
