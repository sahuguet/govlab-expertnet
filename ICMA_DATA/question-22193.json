And, they are centralized in the Department of Information Technology's (DIT) budget.  There are exceptions as follows:\nPersonal Computer Replacements:  During the past several years, replacement PCs have been funded off budget through carryover funds and savings from the previous fiscal year.  DIT receives the funding and manages the replacements.\nPublic Safety Mobile Computers:  These are budgeted in the General Fund but outside of the DIT budget.  The budget is transferred to DIT at the beginning of each fiscal year.\nCopiers (Multi-Function Devices) and Telephones:  These are a component of a Central Services Fund managed by DIT.  There are chargebacks to each department.\nComputer and Software Replacements and new systems:  \n  Items of less than $500,000 are budgeted in a Replacement fund that is a sub-fund of the Captial Projects Fund and component of the Capital Asset Preservation Program.  DIT recommends a contribution to the fund based on a depreciation schedule. The fund balances are carried over from on fiscal year to the next.\nItems with value a cost greater than $500,000 are budgeted as a component of the Captial Improvements Budget.\n\u2022Was it ever done differently from how it is now (i.e. if IT is in the General Fund now, was it previously in its own special fund)?   \nPC replacements used to be funded in a General Fund Non-Departmental budget.  Funding moved to fund balance carryover when the economy became difficult.\nIf IT was moved from the General Fund to an Internal Services fund or vice versa, what was the reason for the switch, and any problems or issues experienced when making the switch?\nNot applicable\n\u2022What are the revenue streams? Is the IT department solely funded by local taxes, do other departments/agencies pay fees for services, a combination of tax dollars and usage fees, fees from outside sources, etc.?\nSome major IT initiatives funded in the Capital Improvement Program budget are funded through bond sales or other borrowed sources.

For about past decade it has all been in an internal service fund.\n\u2022Was it ever done differently from how it is now (i.e. if IT is in the General Fund now, was it previously in its own special fund)?\nResponse: Yes. See above.\n\u2022If IT was moved from the General Fund to an Internal Services fund or vice versa, what was the reason for the switch, and any problems or issues experienced when making the switch?\nResponse: No problems moving except recurring need to explain to council and community how an internal service fund works.  \n\u2022What are the revenues streams? Is the IT department solely funded by local taxes, do other departments/agencies pay fees for services, a combination of tax dollars and usage fees, fees from outside sources, etc.?\nResponse: It has worked very well.  The internal service fund is funded by fees from the users.  IT costs are developed for each key service/software and then charged to the department that uses it. For example, software costs are charged by who has the software on their computer; operating costs are allocated into to key support areas and allocated to related software or activities.\n\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\n\u2022Is the IT department part of the General Fund or does IT have its own special fund \u2013 such as an internal services fund?\nResponse:  The operating expenditures used to be funded from the GF and capital projects had its own fund.
