  "text": "\n\nDoes anyone know of municipalities with a council-manager form of govt. wherein the Council sets individual salaries (not just salary ranges).  Our municipality is researching this matter, and we do not have labor unions.  Due to current issues with transparancy in government and the economic crisis, we are interested in seeing if there are any cases where this is happening.  Any information on the matter will be most appreciated.\n\n",
