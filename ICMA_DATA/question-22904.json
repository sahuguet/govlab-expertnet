  "text": "\n\nWhat is the best way to get started in the local government career?  As someone who was employed at a police department for 18 years, I decided to go back and get a law degree, which I did.  I already have a Master's in Public Administration and did a summer internship at the City Manager's office for the city was employed in before going back to school.  Now I want to get into city administration and as such, what is the best way to be a city manager?  Is it to start in human resources, business services, public relations?  It seems the assistant city manager jobs advertised all want experience as a city manager.  It seems to be circular; be an assistant city manager first to get experience but do not apply to be an assistant if you do not have experience.  \nSuggestions are welcome.\n\n",
