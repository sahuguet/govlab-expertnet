Getting into a director-level or staff level position is greatly aided by networking and joining your state and national professional associations (IEDC for econ, ICMA for management). Also consider attending the regional or national associations for your profession - it's a great way to meet a lot people in one place.\nBut for manager positions, networking alone won't get you there. You typically have to be approved by the council and in some cases panel(s) of residents/community members. Convincing them of not only your managerial acumen but understanding and ability to negotiate/lead  the diffuse power structure managers have to deal with (e.g. what a private CEO can accomplish by saying, \"go do it\" versus in a local government with citizens, businesses, council, and other stakeholders). \nOne other thing to focus on in your resume is highlighting your \"transferable skills\" - those skill-sets that while not IN local government or government, can be seamlessly applied to the work.
