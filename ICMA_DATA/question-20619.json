      "text": "\n\nTo the question, public safety departments are prone to having recommended FTE's based on population. National organizations often provide these figures. This is not as common for other public services. From a public works standpoint, staffing seems to be more financially driven.  However, in the snow belt, street department staffing is generally determined by how many operators are needed during snow events.  Staffing for treatment facilities, water and waste water, are determined by volume and complexity of the operations.  Parks and recreation is often determined by number of staff available for maintaining the facilities with the peak workload coming during the summer months.  I have seen several communities hire season employees for a lot of the work tasks or contract out for the services.  \nHR Green completed had completed a study for Abu Dhabi that included a task to recommend FTE's based on a revised process. We approached the issue by looking at each process, identifying participants, time and resources required to complete the process, and efficiencies that can be garnered via process refinements. This exercise generated a decent analysis relative to staffing needs (e.g., number and skills).\n\n\nTo the question, public safety departments are prone to having recommended FTE's based on population.
