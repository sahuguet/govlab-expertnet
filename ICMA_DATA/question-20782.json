  "text": "\n\nWe are in the initial phases of developing an RFP for a compensation plan study.  The purpose of the study is to identify the best practice for local government compensation (e.g., step plan, pay for performance, etc.) and then outline a detailed implementation plan.  If you have completed such an analysis (or parts thereof) in the past 5 years, would you be willing to share a copy of your RFP and/or the resulting study?  I want to ensure that we have a tight scope of services for the project and it would help to see what our peers have done.  I could not find anything on the document server.\nThanks for your help.\n\n",
