  "text": "\n\nMy community currently issues business licenses to all businesses that are not required to hold a State license.  The system is heavy on regulation and light on communication.  While business licensing does provide a revenue stream for the Village it is somewhat insignificant.\nI am looking for alternative structures that will allow us to better communicate with our business community, and to gather information on our current businesses that allow for market assessment.\nThanks in advance for your input.\n\n",
