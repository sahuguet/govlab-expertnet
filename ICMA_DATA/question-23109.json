  "text": "\n\nOak Hill is re-assessing how we address maintenance of culverts within the public right-of-way, but under private driveways.  In the past, we have cleaned these structures when they are clogged.  However with less resources and no stormwater fee, this is becoming problematic.  Please tell me whether your city cleans out driveway culverts.  If so, do you levy a stormwater fee?  If not, how do you address situations where they become clogged and prevent water flow\n\n",
