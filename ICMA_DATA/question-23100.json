If your community is quite small (e.g. 1-2 thousand), then it may make some sense to let a larger regional authority run the distribution system for  you.  Economies of scale may benefit your citizens.\nHowever, if you are a medium to large community, and especially if your system includes a raw water treatment facility, then please don't sell it without first conducting a very thorough financial (present worth) analysis of all your options, including the option of keeping the system.  Utility operators may offer you lump sum amounts that will excite your governing body, but without looking at the long term implications you may be getting a short term gain and a long term regret.\n\n\nYou don't mention the size of your community or the scope of  your service area, so that complicates the response a little bit.

The council can only make phone calls, pass resolutions, etc.  They cannot deal directly with it.  They get beat up anyway.  This will happen.  It is just a matter of time.  Think garbage and cable complaining.\n2. Frequently a common rate is enacted among systems that the regional authority owns.  Invariably it is a rate higher than the city believes it should pay, and probably is.  The city can be subsidizing other users capital and operating needs, or receiving benefit from other cities.\n3. Any cash paid up front by the regional authority must be amortized within the system being sold.  So sell the system, get a check, and whoever pays the purchase price must amortize that in the rates.  Rates must go up as a result.  Citizens have a good sense of smell on this one.\n4. Any transfers that the city is making from water to the general fund to help defray costs of administration, etc. are gone unless the city assesses the regional authority as if it was a private utility.\n5. The City is out of control of its system.  This can be difficult if, for instance, the City needs to do an expansion to serve a new industry/development............and the regional authority has no interest in shouldering that load for whatever reason.\n6. The city should develop a mechanism by which it can dissolve any purchase agreements.  It's much cheaper to address it up front than after the fact.  It probably gets expensive if needed, but then the citizens have access to their elected representatives and can more effectively complain, usually to the city's chagrin.  But that is the democratic process.\n7. There could be benefit in allowing a regional authority to operate a system.  Licensed operators can be difficult to come by, particularly in smaller towns.  In theory, a larger operator will be more sophisticated and able to pay higher wages to attract qualified water/wastewater plant operators.\n8. It will be easier to keep rates at the level needed to provide improvements.  The city can simply blame increases on the regional authority.\n9. If owned by a regional authority it may be easier to adopt and stick with \"best practices\", such as routine annual line replacements and plant rehabs that are frequently ignored or underfunded.\n\n\nDetails would help, but there are plenty of general positives and negatives.

I'm trying to assess, conceptually, reasons why the governing body should and should not give up its own utilities.  Thoughts and opinions?  All responses are appreciated.\n\n",
