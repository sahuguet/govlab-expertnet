  "text": "\n\nIf a major maintenance emergency occurs during an otherwise normal construction process, do any communities have an emergency provision related to change orders? Specifically - a contractor recently discovered a major utility issue when doing some road excavation. Our DOT told them to go ahead with the work and the county would process the change order later. Obviously this is against our typical change order policy, though we made an exception because of the emergency the issue could have caused for health and public welfare.\nDoes anyone have a purchasing policy/change order policy with language related to emergency work?\n\n",
