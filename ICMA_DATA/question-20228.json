They are all from a strongly free market organization called the Reason Foundation, and should therefore be taken as a somewhat biased presentation, but they also are well-researched and offer good starting point.  I have added them to the Knowledge Network for your ease of access.\n1)  Cutting Costs for States Prisons \u2013 although this deals with state prisons, there are some very eye-opening statistics here, such as \u201cNot only are costs lower in private prisons, but the competition they provide helps drive down costs in state-run prisons as well. A study of New Mexico \u2013 which contracts out 45 percent of its correctional system \u2013 found the state spent $10,000 less per prisoner per year than peer states that had no privately operated correctional facilities. A March 2009 Avondale Partners survey of 30 state correctional agencies, many of which use privately operated correctional facilities, found that contracted prisons cost 28 percent less than state-run facilities.\u201d  If these sorts of changes could be mirrored at the local level, the savings could be enormous (http://icma.org/en/Article/100485/Cutting_Costs_for_States_Prisons)\n2)  Innovative Alternatives to Traditional Municipal/County Corrections \u2013 Although this is an older article, it presents a very innovative way of saving costs and improving efficiency in the system: essentially setting up a separate, higher-quality facility for non-violent inmates, but they have to pay for those facilities ($70 per day, at the time of writing), which not only defrays the cost of running the small facility, but also pays for some of the costs of the regular county jail.  It is an innovative model, worth taking a look at as a source of inspiration (http://icma.org/en/Article/100483/Innovative_Alternatives_to_Traditional_MunicipalCounty_Corrections)\n3)  Comparing the Performance of Private and Public Prisons - this article is based almost solely on that cost benefits analysis you were looking for; the author uses a report like that from the Arizona Department of Corrections that looks into how they benefited from privatization (http://icma.org/en/Article/100484/Comparing_the_Performance_of_Private_and_Public_Prisons)\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nHi Brian:\n\nI have found several articles that go into this practice to some length, and have a high level of detail.
