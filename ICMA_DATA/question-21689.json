  "text": "\n\nOur community is requiring customer service training for all of our employees.  The curriculum is basic, and we are trying to revise it to match the requirements for police officers and the concepts of community policing.  Does anyone have any outlines, training material suggestions, resources, etc.., on how we might be able to teach customer service to police officers during a four-hour training course?  It seems to be a popular concept across the country, and we would be grateful for any help with the curriculum. \nthank you!\n\n",
