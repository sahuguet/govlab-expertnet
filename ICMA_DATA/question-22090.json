Does it have a name? Is it linked from your ICMA profile? How often do you update?  How do you quanitify/assess the readership? If you started, then dropped, how come? If you're thinking about it, but haven't started it, how come? Are your peers finding time to read it? \nYes, I've asked many questions. As time allows, please tell me your thoughts, interests, and inclinations.\nGwen Harvey, ACM \nOrange County, NC\n\n",
