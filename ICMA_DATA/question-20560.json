A previous organization I was with, the City of San Bruno, did this and it worked well for minor updates but not for major revamp/re-branding site overhauls.  That work was contracted out.  They had a committee (acutally web work group was a subcomittee of the city's Technology Users Group) which met regularly.  I think this also works best if departments have control over content but not basic design.  Finally, web software is a big consideration because you will have people in different departments at various skill levels and need something that's very easy to use to make the web updates without being a programmer.  I'd be curious to hear about your experiences.\n\n\nWe are going down this path right now.

We overlayed a website manager/editor (a member of our public information office) as the person responsible for training these content editors and looking at the entire site's look, feel and content. That person would make suggestions to content editors about look/feel and about what should be updated or added, and hold regular meetings of the group of content editors to share experiences, tips and such, look at webpages and offer suggestions, etc. \nBut as with all things, unless the director of the department thinks about the web user and makes it a priority for THEIR work, that doesn't get conveyed to the content editor and no sense of urgency exits about using the web for business or for information sharing. I suggest you add to the director's annual performance plan an element for web content and customer use of the web and make it a part of the conversation about \"how are you running your department?\" each year.\n\n\nWhat has worked at a previous organization (and what we are trying to do here in Aspen now) is to do what you have done - create content editors for each department/part of the organization with web pages -- and give them the responsibility for updating their pages.

What tips or tricks can you share to keep your site fresh and relevant? Do you have any type of formal policy or committee with regular meetings?
