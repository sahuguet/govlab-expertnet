Specifically, we should consider hiring generalists (individuals who have prepared themselves through a graduate degree, internships, etc.) for some of the positions that have historically been filled by specialists. These areas could include transit, economic development, utility management, libraries, parks and recreation, and many others.  The individual would need to be able to learn quickly, and be genuinely interested in the area. But I think we would find that capable generalists with strong management training & skills might be better for our organization than individuals with more narrow technical knowledge. I tried this approach with our Finance Director position (filled by ICMA member Seth Atkinson) and have been very pleased with the outcome.\n\n\nPart of the answer to this (real) dilemma might require new thinking about entry level positions and career paths.

While a student at Arizona State University's MPA program, I went from city-to-city offering my assistance pro-bono without success for over three months.  It wasn't until John Kross, Town Manager at Queen Creek, finally saw the passion I had for this field and facilitated an opportunity for me to work with his public works staff.  This simple gesture opened numerous doors for me in this profession, but I am still troubled to this day that it took me months of pleading with numerous managers to find pro-bono experience.  There is definitely room for improvement with our current managers and universities to facilitate opportunities for our future community leaders.\n\n\nI agree with Mr. Davidson's comments.

You come in work hard for three years and contribute to the organization while you learn our profession and then you leave.

We think you should be ready fo an ACM position or a CM position in a smaller city.\nAnother program we have implemented is a program called ILEAD.  We take applications and select about 15 staff to be in a one year training program.  We are grooming future leaders and managers in our organization.\nWe also need to pick up the phone and call other managers that have openings when one of these young great individuals is roadblocked in our organization.  Since there are not many jobs in the managers office anymore, we must identify young  quality professionals in other departments and help them move into our profession even if it is not in our own organization. \nThere are great people out there.

I have hosted two interns in my five years as a manager, but am surprised at how many longtime managers with great knowledge & experience don't make this a regular practice.  Additionally, in hiring during the downturn, managers should consider young & ambitious MPA's for clerical-type positions for which they are \"overeducated\".  While in good times this might be a recipe for job-hopping, in our current times it may be the only way to effectively cultivate the next generation by allowing our future leaders to gain relevant experience.  The young & inexperienced will make more mistakes and require more supervision at first, but I've found that their enthusiasm and critical-thinking & people skills can often more than make up for any shortfalls.  Finally, I'd love to see a \"Teach for America\" scale program to introduce young people to local government service as a career field.\n\n\nI agree with much of what has already been said.

  "text": "\n\nGilbert Davidson, Town Manager, Marana, Arizona, wrote an article in the June 2010 issue of AZ Management about the importance of building the capacity of the next generation. In it, he reminds us that:\n\"The success of our communities rests with the talent and skill of our workforce. It is in our best interest as an Association and as individual members to develop and expand our partnership with our state universities. We must ensure that talent is being developed and that universities are partners in this important endeavor.\"\nand\u2026\n\"Cities and towns across the state have faced a number of recessionary challenges over the past several years. Most communities have confronted fiscal realities by reducing expenditures and modifying services and programs provided to the general populous. The identification of core services and programs has become a pressing priority.\"\nMr. Davidson closes with a call to engage tomorrow\u2019s managers:\n\"We must do everything possible as an Association to encourage the best and brightest college students to take advantage of opportunities in public service. The fiscal challenges we face are not going away any time soon. They will require the commitment of a whole new generation of leaders who have knowledge and experience. ACMA should do all it can to give today's college students a head-start on solving tomorrow's problems. In the end, everyone will benefit.\"\nThere\u2019s no countering the fact that times are bad. Budgets are tighter than ever, even after resorting to the drastic measures of layoffs, furloughs, cutting services, or taking on debt. None of these measures are sustainable.\nAt the same time, member stories and a future of opportunity are attracting a new generation of graduates to the profession. The big puzzle piece missing is for a place they can land after graduating, or even concurrent with their studies. Many students and career changers have told stories that they cannot find even unpaid internships, a heavy burden to bear on top of loans, living costs, and in many cases family.\nNow is the time for creative thinking. How can we at the national, state, school, and jurisdiction levels help build capacity in the next generation, engage them in the profession, and give them meaningful experiences that will help them succeed not only to benefit our communities today, but ready them for when today\u2019s managers move on?\n\n",
