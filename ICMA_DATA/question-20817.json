For the most part it seems as though police departments randomly select individuals who have recently had contact with the department to send (via letter or email) a very simple survey.     \nSome examples of the format of these surveys are:    \nThe Oakland, California Housing Authority Police Department:    \nwww.ohapd.org/attachment/BrochureCustSatisAdm.pdf     \nThe LaSalle, Ontario, Canada Police Department:    \nwww.police.lasalle.on.ca/pdf/CommunitySatisfactionSurvey.pdf     \nExamples of reports once they have been compiled are:    \nThe San Fernando Police Department, which conducted its survey by telephone:    \nhttp://www.ci.san-fernando.ca.us/city_government/departments/police/Citizen%20Satis%20Survey%202010.pdf \nThe 2010 Victoria, Texas Executive Summary of their online survey results which not only outlines how the department distributed the survey, but also results, lessons learned, and next steps:    \nhttp://bit.ly/e6xsCz \nLet me know if that answers your question, and if not I can try and find different resources.    \nAmanda Dodge    \nKnowledge Network Intern    \nICMA    \n202-962-3699    \nadodge@icma.org\n\n\nHi Pamela,    \nI am not entirely sure that this is what you are looking for, but I have found a few examples of documents used by police departments to collect customer satisfaction survey information.

You can view the online survey here: http://www.cityofvancouver.us/police.asp?policeID=34414&policeSubID=34420. \nThe second survey is from City of Bonney Lake and its intent is to get the evaluation of the quality of service that the Police Department has provided. It can be found here: http://www.ci.bonney-lake.wa.us/section_government/departments/police/community_service/citizen_survey.shtml\nThe third survey is from Sequim, WA and focuses more on its citizens to propose what the department should focus its  resources in the future. I hope this helps.\n\n\nHi, \nThe following surveys may be useful to the Alliance member. The first is from Vancouver and is perhaps more aligned with your question.

  "text": "\n\nAn Alliance member is asking if there are PDs that have done their own customer satisfaction surveys for non-emergency service delivery, communications, etc?   Not professional surveys with a consultant or firm but for ex: do they follow-up with people who have had in person, or by phone, or by website, etc contact with the Police Department as a means for improvement.\nThank you,\nPamela Muse\nWestern Regional Director\nAlliance for Innovation\n888-468-6450\npmuse@transformgov.org\n\n",
