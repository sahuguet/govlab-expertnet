  "text": "\n\nHi-\nI've read through a lot of posts with some great advice about how to facilitate and encourage citizen engagement in the budget process (online forums, extended budget hearings, more informal, town hall meetings, online suggestion boxes etc.), but what do you do with the information and input that you receive from your community?  How do you integrate public input into the development of budget recommendations?  And more importantly, how do you show the community that you've listened to them and that their input was valuable (or at least taken into consideration)?\nDoes anyone have any advice or best practices to share along these lines?\nThank you!\n\n",
