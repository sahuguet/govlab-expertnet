Landfill operations, janitorial, trash collection, mowing, payroll, utility billing, desk top support, wide area network operation and recruitment to name a few.  I have disdain for the word \"privatization\" as I feel that it is our stewardship job as mangers to provide the best service for the least dollars and how we do that is of little relevance.  In that context \"privatization\" is a political word most often used by unions. \nThe key is to understand your fully loaded costs and the nature of your business plan and the level of service provided, as what you do and how you think you do it may be quite different.  This will impact the ability to write a contract and the ability to manage expectations of the community and your elected board afterward.  When you enter into a contract you don't have the ability to be so felxible.  We also gave employee units the right to bid and even provided them with accounting services and someone to help write the response.  They generally fail because the benefits side of our fully load costs do not permit them to make a competitive bid.  I will comment about employee sourcing at the end.  \nThat resolved, it is very important to shift skills from employee management to contract writing and managmeent.  These competancies do not usually reside within the same manager who used to supervise an internal operation and is now expected to manage and external one.  So part of the evaluation should also be one of assessing the required management competancies in this different world.\nJust to go down one rabbit trail here.  I had an analysis done asking the question \"if we created a side by side corporation who did all of our employee hiring and that sourced those employees to us through contract, what would that look like and mean?\"  Of course there are laws on the books that make such long term employee leasing arrangmenets impossible.  But the investigation told us several things.  First, we could likely hire certain classes of employees for about $7,000 less per year when toal compensation is factored in (about14%).  Second, in conjunction with the work we did on RIFs, the analysis revealed to us that we likely consider as \"full time\" many positions which we could manage on a seasonal or rotational basis.\n\n\nWe have privatized several services.
