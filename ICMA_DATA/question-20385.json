It has been my experience that state municipal leagues typically have advertisements for jobs in smaller entities.  The National League of Cities has links for most if not all of the state municipal leagues.  On the other hand, ICMA and state city management association newsletters and websites will occasionally include advertisements for entry level support positions.  Some states also have associations for assistants (e.g. Illinois Association of Municipal Management Assistants - www.iamma.org) that are great resources.  ICMA's career resources webpage has some good stuff as well. Let me know if you need any additional information.\n\n\nDo you want to start with a small municipality or as a support staff member in a larger entity?

  "text": "\n\nHello all,\nI just recently graduated with my MPA and am looking for a job in the public sector.  I have started applying to jobs.  At present, I have been going to local municipalities websites to look for open positions.  Are there resources that anyone can recommend that I should check out?  I am currently in Arizona but would have no problem with relocating.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much!\nAnbar Ahmed\n\n",
