In the case of rescue and property damage, you can pursue liability claims on the insurance.\n\n\nThe first question in forming the analysis is what do you need to know and why do you need to know it.

We've seen the faillure of that with High Pressure nozzle in the 60', we see today the faillure of that with ventilation in the 90' and we'll see in the future the faillure of that with CAFS.
