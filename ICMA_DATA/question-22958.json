  "text": "\n\nMy name is Anthony Hunter, and I am a current MPA student at the University of Arizona in Tucson. This semester I am working on an internship project for a smaller (~40K) municipality in the area. Essentially, my task is to craft a growth plan for different levels of population increase (50K, 75K, 100K, and 150K). I am to look closely at every department and town services function and see what will be needed at each level and how changes can best be implemented without disruption to town services.\nMy questions are related to the best practices research that I'll be needing to do for the project:\nAre there reliable online or academic resources for best practices information? Or would approaching it on a city by city basis be more appropriate? Is there an entirely different way to go about it?\nAlso: if you have any examples of cities or towns that have experienced exponential growth and met the challenge successfully, I could sure use a few bread crumbs to make a trail out of. \nThank you very much for taking the time to help.\nSincerely,\nAnthony Hunter\nMPA Student\nThe University of Arizona\n\n",
