      "text": "\n\nMike:\nIt looks like you are working on Questions 61-63 on the CPM 101 survey, and the crux of the question is whether or not your Sports Center is considered a \"specialized facility\".\nBackground. In both the CPM 101 Program as well as the CPM Comprehensive Program, we define \"specialized facilities\" as facilities such as skate parks, zoos, amphitheaters, museums, theaters, bowling centers, water parks, and BMX parks. We ask that you exclude (in CPM 101) or account for separately (in Comprehensive) the hours paid, expenditures and revenues associated with \"specialized facilities\".  \nIn the Comprehensive Program, we also account for hours paid, expenditures and revenues related to swimming pools separately, whereas, in CPM 101, the compact nature of the survey requires us to simply ignore hours paid, expenditures, and revenues related to swimming pools. It's not that they are \"specialized facilities\" per se', it's just that we have chosen not to measure them in the CPM 101 Program.\nThe bottom line is that hours paid, expenditures, and revenues for specialized facilities and pools/aquatics programs are NOT reported in the questions where we ask for hours paid, expenditures, and revenues for general recreation programs. This is true in both CPM 101 and the Comprehensive Program.\nYour Sports Center.  With that background, let\u2019s focus on your Sports Center.  By your description, it seems like it includes a significant pool and aquatics program, alongside a number of traditional, general recreation programs. For the purposes of the CPM 101 survey, then, we would ask you to treat the Sports Center as a combination of two facilities.  One is the pool, and the other is the more traditional facility.\nTherefore, in CPM 101 Question 61, please back out (ignore) the hours paid for the pool/aquatics portion and simply include the hours paid for the non-aquatics activities.  In Question 62, please back out (ignore) the expenditures for the pool/aquatics portion and simply include the expenditures for the non-aquatics activities.  And, in Question 63, please back out (ignore) the revenues from the pool/aquatics portion and simply include the revenues related to the non-aquatics activities.\nIf you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to contact me directly at 202.536.4418 or dgloo@icma.org.\n\n\nMike:\nIt looks like you are working on Questions 61-63 on the CPM 101 survey, and the crux of the question is whether or not your Sports Center is considered a \"specialized facility\".\n\nBackground.

  "text": "\n\nThe City of Monterey owns and operates a Sports Center.  Facilities include a pool with lifeguards and swim programs, Cardio and weight rooms, a long list of fitness-related classes and all the associated staff and operating costs for a large facility.\nOur question is, should any of this be included in the survey responses, or is it all excluded as specialised activities?  This question was left as voice main on 02/09/12 and no response has been received.\nThank you!!!\n\n",
