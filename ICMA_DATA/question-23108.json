Operational requirements for solid-fuel-fired devices. An outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be operated in a manner not to create noxious or hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors, or air pollution resulting in a detrimental effect on the occupants of nearby properties or on the public. \nC. Substantive requirements. Any outdoor solid-fuel-fired device or boiler installed after the effective date of August 1, 2009, shall be installed in accordance with this subsection and Subsection D of this section. \n(1) An outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall comply with all applicable standards governing air quality and emissions as may be promulgated and amended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. \n(2) An outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be certified by a recognized product testing laboratory such as Underwriters' Laboratories (UL), Canadian Standards Association (CSA), or Intertek (ETL). \n(3) The outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be located not less than 350 feet from the nearest inhabited building which is not on the same property as the outdoor solid-fuel-fired device. \n(4) The outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be located not less than 50 feet from any structures on the same lot as the solid-fuel-fired device. This distance may be decreased if allowed by the manufacturer's specifications. \n(5) If there are any residences located within 500 feet of the solid-fuel-fired device, the chimney of the appliance may need to extend at least as high above the ground surface as the height of the roofs of all such residences. The Building Inspector may approve a lesser height on a case-by-case basis if necessary to comply with the manufacturer's recommendations and if the smoke from a lower chimney does not create a nuisance. \n(6) An outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be fitted with an electro-mechanical-draft combustion system. \n(7) An outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall be fitted with a secondary heat exchanger, also known as a two-pass heat exchanger. \n(8) All outdoor solid-fuel-fired devices shall be equipped with properly functioning spark arrestors. \n(9) The owner of a solid-fuel-fired device shall provide a copy of his or her survey showing the proposed location of the appliance, the distance to the lot line, and the distance to the nearest neighbor's residence. \n(10) Outdoor solid-fuel-fired devices are permitted only in the rear yard, unless approved otherwise by a special permit granted by the Village Board on a case-by-case basis. \nD.

Such permits may be obtained from the office of the Village Building Inspector upon payment of a fee established by a separate resolution of the Village Board. The Building Inspector may issue the permits upon finding that the solid-fuel-fired device will be located, constructed and used in accordance with the requirements of this section. \n(5) If a property owner submits an application to change the zoning designation of a parcel with an outdoor solid-fuel-fired device to another designation that does not allow an outdoor solid-fuel-fired device and the Village Board makes the requested change, the outdoor solid-fuel-fired device shall cease to operate upon enactment of the ordinance changing the designation. \nE. Existing outdoor solid-fuel-fired devices. All existing units at the time of passage of this section which are not in compliance with the requirements of this section may remain as nonconforming units until such time as the solid-fuel-fired device is replaced or significantly repaired, at which time the solid-fuel-fired device will be brought into compliance with this section. \nF.

Stats. \n(2) Special exception. Where the Village finds that extraordinary hardship will occur from the enforcement of this section, upon application to the Village Board, said Village Board may vary the regulations contained herein to afford substantial justice, provided that such special exception will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this section. \nH. Property owner's assumption of all risks. Persons responsible for lighting fires in the Village of Richfield assume all risks associated with such fire. Compliance with the requirements of this section shall not relieve such person from the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the fire is conducted safely and appropriately with due regard for the health, safety, and welfare of all persons and property potentially affected by the fire.
