Initially, it'll just be for our fleet (which we're looking into converting to CNG), but we aim to make it a public station. It'll cost around $1.3-1.5 million, and we received a CMAQ grant to cover $700,000 of the costs. We may also create a PPP moving forward.\nNote that there are basically two types of CNG stations: slow-fill (which fill up vehicles overnight and is a cheaper option) and fast-fill (more comparable to your standard gas station, in terms of the time it takes to fill up a vehicle).  Hamilton's CNG station will be fast-fill; we don't want to discourage people from using it because it takes too long to fill up.\nFrom everything I've read, CNG is a great option for refuse trucks, as they use so much fuel and return to a centralized location; I've seen simple paybacks of <3 years. It can make sense for other fleet vehicles, as they also return to a centralized location to refuel, but that depends on fuel price differentials, vehicle lifecycles, MPG, annual fuel usage, incremental cost of CNG systems, and other factors. Each vehicle will differ in terms of economic feasibility.\nAlthough Hamilton is a municipal utility, we purchase gas from Atmos Energy (who looks to be Olathe's supplier), and they have been very supportive of this project. I'd suggest reaching out to them moving forward, as this is essentially a new market for them.\nIn terms of resources, the Business Case for Compressed Natural Gas in Municipal Fleets (see Pam's response) is useful, as is The Compelling Case For NGVs in Public and Private Fleets (see attached). For an economic analysis, and what the Business Case for CNG describes, you could use the DOE's Clean Cities VICE model (http://www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/news_detail.html?news_id=17674). Clean Cities KC (http://www.kcenergy.org/kccleancities.aspx) may also be a good resource for available grants & as a knowledge base. \nFeel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

The station is dedicated to fueling the refuse trucks. Since it went into service in March 2011 we have had excellent operating results, no equipment downtime while saving about $200K per year using natural gas versus diesel. The refuse employees prefer CNG trucks because they are so clean burning, operate very quietly, and the trucks fill overnight at the yard and ready to roll in the morning (no need to waste time going to a fueling station)\nWe have our own fueling station and we also use other fueling stations.  DPU owns and operates the refuse CNG station for the refuse trucks. The City also purchases CNG from an investor owned station. \nIn September 2012, Clean Energy opened a public access CNG station in Richmond. The station is located about a mile from our Department of Public Utilities Operations Center.  Instead of building a 2nd CNG fueling facility, we decided to use the Clean Energy station for all new (non refuse truck) CNG vehicles.  Our local municipally owned transit company (GRTC) recently signed a contract with Trillium CNG to build their station which will eventually fuel over 200 CNG buses. Until it is completed in January 2014 GRTC, will use the Clean Energy station too.  Other agencies within the City are investigating or in the process of purchasing CNG vehicles to replace gasoline or diesel trucks. So far, the Clean Energy Station has been operating great. Our current price per GGE is approximately $1.60.\nPlease feel free to call Michael Kearns in DPU Energy Services at 804-646-5215 or Michael.Kearns@Richmondgov.com if you have any additional questions.\n\n\nThe City of Richmond, Department of Public Works  (DPW) purchased 25 CNG refuse trucks and the Department of Public Utilities (DPU -Gas Utility Department) built a time- fill CNG in 2011.
