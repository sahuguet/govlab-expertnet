Over time these vacant homes became a terrible blight. The city used property tax delinquency foreclosures to acquire many properties. Some were sold by auction, some as part of a lottery, and some were demolished to allow for sale lots. Lots were for future owner-occupied homes or were assembled into larger parcels to encourage reuse.\nYou might try checking with the Center for Governmental Research (cgr.org) to see if they performed any analysis of the demolition and reuse program.\nMurray Levison\nCity of Sacramento, CA\n\n\nRichard,\n\nIn the 1980s I worked for the City of Rochester, NY.
