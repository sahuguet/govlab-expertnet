  "text": "\n\nwith the current accent on environment considerations, the position of the city environment manager should be taking on increasing importance.  i am a researcher trying to explore the various models that exist in cities for allocating mandate, authority to this position, e.g.\n is the city env manager the responsible for legislating the environmental policy for a city? \ndo they act as watchdogs to ensure environmental compliance?\nis there entire mandate a 'given' or are there some models where they acts as service providers that are contracted by other entities in the city to take care of certain environmental aspects.\nhavnt been able to get an answer to these questions based on existing models though many hypothetical models can be thought of.  \nif you are responding to this, please do refer the name of the city/ municipality where such roles are established and functioning\nthank you \njaya\n\n",
