  "text": "\n\nHello:\nThe GFOA is conducting research on keys to successful labor negotiations/relations in tough economic times. We wish to discover A) how to work successfully with the labor force to arrive at a sustainable compensation structure; and B) what the finance officers' ideal role is in labor relations. We hope to publish the results of our research both in GFOA and ICMA magazines. \nWe are hoping that you can help us with this by sharing your success stories (or perhaps lessons learned). We always recognize contributors to the article (if they like) and give contributors the opportunity to review articles before they are published. \nIf you'd like to help us out, please let me know.\nThanks!\nShayne Kavanagh,\nGFOA\n\n",
