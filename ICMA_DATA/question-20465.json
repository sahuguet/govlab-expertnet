It's great because those departments that have vehicles and equipment fully reflect the cost of their operations.  The Budget Office works closely with the Fleet Maintenance Division each year to provide the estimates to those departments. I have attached the estimates provided in FY 2011 that departments used to develop their budget requests.  Another advantage is that the General Fund does not bear the full brunt of these costs - many of the effected departments are Non General Funds, including utilities.  \nHope this helps!\n\n\nOur Fleet Maintenence costs are completely cost allocated out to those applicable departments.

The only way to determine the opportunities to be more efficient is to know all the costs and from where those cost are generated.  One of the things I did was create a category of \"cost of governance\" or the price of democracy.  This is all the costs associated with City Council and Commission  activities and staff support, special government filings, and other costs that the private sector would not suffer.  By being able to back out these costs related to the service or capital, it allows a more legitimate comparison of costs related to private sector  costs of providing that same service or capital.  A public entity simple has mandatory costs that the private sector does not bear and these should be clear so the agency is not painted as unduly inefficient.\n\n\nYes many cities have done so.

I would suggest that you go beyond just cost allocations and consider moving to a true fee-for-service basis.\nAt the City of Albany, Oregon our Engineering and other Public Works support operation (including deparmental administration)  operate as an internal service fund.\nEngineering, for example, does monthly charge-backs based on actual billable hours for project management, permit review, and counter services via our project accounting system.\nCosts are essentially based on (employee salary & benefits + indirect/Overhead costs) / Estimated Billable hours. Indirect & overhead includes a portion of departmental administration. Billable hours only includes direct service hours: At work hours not spent on service activities (training, meetings, general supervision, unaccounted time, non-service providing managers) are treated as part of the overhead/indirect cost. \nWhat you end up with is a true enterprise model, comparable to private sector practices, where the emphasis shifts towards maximizing billable hours to reduce the per-unit  cost.\n\n\nWhile allocationg fleet and other internal costs is done by a lot of cities.
