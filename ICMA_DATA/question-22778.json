The program is operated by the Bureau of Justice (BJA), CNA and involves more than 30 law enforcement agencies. \nThe program is broken into several groups and I am familiar with some of the work produced by Philadelphia which was presented at a recent Esri User Conference in San Diego.  Los Angeles has also been involved and reported good success. I believe on the CNA link through the SPI website you can download the first reports being produced.\n\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nYou might want to look at research and the first papers produced by the \"Smart Policing Initiative\" (SPI).
