  "text": "\n\nHi all,\nWe're looking into doing an internal space utilization assessment.  Although the alternative would be to hire a firm to complete the task for us, has any municipality conducted their own?  Are the benchmarks and recommendations feasible and comparable to those of external firms?  Can you post documents if you've completed an assessment (please include those of external assessments -- we want to know the processes, information/data collection, and analysis).\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
