It has a ton of articles and blogs that you can use to get some ideas for events or see what others are doing to reinvent old traditions.

The best events are ones that have some reputation and have been here awhile.  New events may take a few years to catch on.   We try to have events that fit the branding of our community as a relaxed mountain village.  It's also good to capitalize on the assets you already have that can differentiate yourself from other competing events.  For us, the extensive amount of wildlife in town is a major asset, as well we are adjacent to Rocky Mt. National Park.  We have an Elk Fest in the fall when the elk are bugleing, Autumn Gold for the aspen turning.   We're going toward the third year for the Stanley Film Festival, a horror film festival at our historic Stanley Hotel (Stephen King's inspiration for The Shining), and we do a very large Scottish/Irish Festival that attracts over 50,000 people to attend (our pop ~ 6500).   \nWe recently began being more strategic about our events and formed a citizens group to look at events.  Rather than just react to requests or ideas, we are looking at when do we need events to fill in our calendar, what type of demographic do we want to attract, what is the competition, what events fit our community and our existing assets, and what is the cost/benefit ratio for the event.\nIt seems like every event has some detractors.  If we do an outdoor art show, the art galleries aren't pleased.   If we do an event with a parade, or race that closes a road, some retailers aren't pleased.   If we promote an event that is a day trip type of event, the lodging establishments don't like it as much as events that have people staying overnight, even if the retailers are happy.\nWe also try to not just look at events as opportunities to attract guests, but some events are amenities that add to the quality of life for residents as well.   I think that's an important ED issue as well, in order to attract a creative young workforce and families, the quality of life and things to do for them is very important.\nWe don't try to recruit events away from other communities.  That can cut both ways.  Partially because we don't do that, we get events and groups referred to us from other communities who may not have the dates or facilities and they send them our way.  We do the same.  It's better to have collaborators than competitors.\nFrank Lancaster\nEstes Park, Colorado\n\n\nWe do a lot with events and we are expanding in this area as well.

  "text": "\n\nDoes your city/municipality recruit special events? \nThe goal of the event could be an economic development or a recreation program or tourism. I have found that many sports events are four-wall and moveable, but require a bidding fee and usually only plan for one year. These are regional and national championships with everything from badminton, to Senior Games, to USA Triathlon. While they do enhance the profile of the city, they are not tourism generators past the year of the event.\nDoes anyone have success in finding festivals (music, food, special interest) that would relocate or expand to your city? \n(I am not interested in mud runs or themed 5ks). While they can be well attended, there are too many in the region to create a dent in out of town visitors.\n\n",
