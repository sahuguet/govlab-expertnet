The US News ratings do tend to highlight those programs that are valued because they receive the resources needed to compete. As noted above, give some thought to where you would like to live and look for commitments to topics you care about. Assume nothing. Full disclosure--I am an NIU grad. The environs are sparse, but the the Chicago metro area is busting with possibilities, the MPA program is valued there, and the faculty are committed to public management and local government. Choose nothing less.\n\n\nI agree that you can get what you need anywhere, but if you have some freedom of choice, then you should know that all MPA (and MPP) programs are not the same. They are shaped primarily by their locations, their relative importance in their universities, and their faculty.

  "text": "\n\nI am trying to decide between three graduate schools for my MPA. American University, Arizona State University, and Florida State University. American is ranked 14th for their MPA program (nationally by US News Weekly), ASU is 25th, and FSU is 27th. However, American costs $10,000 more than the other two schools. Is paying that much more for a school that is only ranked 10 spots higher worth it in the eyes of prospective employers?\nIf I narrow my options down to ASU and FSU, which school would you recommend? My career goal is to become a county, city, or town manager and I want my education to benefit me as much as possible.\n\n",
